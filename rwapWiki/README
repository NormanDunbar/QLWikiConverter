In this folder you will find:

RwapWiki - a utility which reads a single page file, created by WikiPager, and converts it to
almost any output format you desire - provided you tell it which conversion format you need it to be in
when complete.

There's an example, convert.html.txt file provided and a blank template to allow you to create your own.

The utility can hopefully be used to output text formats for other Wikis, or whatever format you need the 
Wiki Pages to be - text? LaTeX? XML? etc. It's up to you to provide the (printer.dat!) type file to make
the conversions.

*** It cannot handle Image Galleries, if a Wiki page has one of these, you get a warning to the standard error channel.

*** Because you need to download images used in the Wiki pages, there is a list of all images found, and 
their URL, produced on the standard error channel as well. The desired output is written to the standard 
output channel and should be redirected to a suitable output file at your heart's desire. You may wish to 
use something like 'wget' to pull down all the desired images.
