The content.sql script in this folder should be run against the current
RWAP Sinclair QL Wiki's mySql database, similar to the following:

	mysql -u root -p <content.sql >content.out

Obviously, using the root user is considered a bad thing, so run it as the appropriate
user account for the Wiki in question.

The file, content.out in this case, contains the whole wiki (in various languages)
and each wiki page has the following format in the file:

*************************** 1. row ***************************
wikilang: en
wikipage: 2488
wikitext: 2488 is an additional set of printer drivers ...
yada yada yada
Etc etc etc
*************************** 2. row ***************************

The main page in the Wiki is titled 'Sinclair QL Home Computer' and so, will be found
in the file named 'Sinclair-QL-Home-Computer.en.txt' aftr running the 'wikiPager' utility.

These pages are the ones that you will be converting to "some other format" using the
'RwpaWiki' utility found elsewhere.


Cheers,
Norm.
