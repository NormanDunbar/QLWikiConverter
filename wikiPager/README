In this folder you will find:

WikiPager - a utility, or at least, the C++ source code for same, which reads the
file created by the MySQL script 'content.sql' and creates IN THE CURRENT FOLDER an individual text file
for EACH and EVERY Wiki page found in the file created by the afore mentioned script. Run it thus:

	cd <wherever the wikipager executable lives>
	mkdir pages
	cd pages
	../wikipager path/to/content.out

The pages folder will now be filled with one file named "Page Title"."language".txt for each of the Wiki
pages found in the content.out file. The filenames are slightly massaged to remove punctuation and spaces
which is handy as it will then match up to what the following utility creates.
