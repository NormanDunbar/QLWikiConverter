wikitext: 3 Games was a product advertised in the April 1985 issue of QL User, by [QCODE].

It was a single microdrive cartridge containing what would appear to be 3 fairly simple games:
* Sprite Shooting
* Lander
* Moon Landing

Only Sprite Shooting and Lander were marked as being written in Machine Code.

In the December advert, this had become 4 games, but still only the two written in Machine Code.  The extra game was:
* Wall-Up

3D Slime is a 3D arcade action game from [Datalink Systems (Wales)], where you have been captured by Rorick and forced into robot city to steal the master's purple pyramids, without getting smothered by the robotic spheres which seek to flatten you.

Your movement is described as flollopping - presumably this word comes from the movement of the odd little character which you play - a particularly corrosive blob of slime from Vega 3 - he bounces, but as he lands he flattens out !!

The program had an "office" feature where workers afraid of their bosses could press F5 and the game paused, replacing its display with something like a spreadsheet (Megacalc IV).

wikipage: 3D Terrain
wikitext: There are in fact two Sinclair QL programs both called 3D Terrain, which happened to be developed in isolation (one in the UK and one in the USA) at around the same time!  

Both versions are mapping programs capable of creating a contour map of an area and allow you to output the final output to your printer, as well as altering the various axes and scales, used to plot the image.

!!!The UK version (written by Ian Thompson and Rich Mellor, and originally published by [CGH Services]) 
This version is based on the original 3D graph program written by Mike Lloyd and published in Sinclair QL World.  It allows you to take data which has been created in an Abacus spreadsheet and convert it into a 3D graphical representation. Although it can be used for most types of data, it is ideal for contour mapping of areas (an example is provided which draws a terrain chart of Nidderdale in Yorkshire - full details of how the contour map was created are included).

!!!<b>History and Development of the UK Version</b> <i>(by [Ian Thompson])</i>

It’s now over 20 years ago when <i>[3D Terrain]</i> (known originally as <i>TriDT</i> and then as <i>3DT</i>) was in development, and as a general note, why did no-one put dates on letters back then?! Even newsletters and magazines seemed devoid of any dates... So, the dates here are drawn from memory and from the annotated program development documentation, which thankfully still exist!

Back in 1988, [Mike Lloyd] presented a four-part series in <i>[Sinclair QL World]</i> (March, April, May and July issues) that dealt with creating a 3D bar graph of the type we are familiar with today thanks to programs such as Microsoft Excel. It detailed how to build algorithms that turned a numerical grid from a spreadsheet into a 3D bar chart. Mike has always asked that his wife Sue be given credit for contributing a great deal towards the design of the algorithms. (Note, the program SuperBASIC listing REM on line 150 states the original <i>[Sinclair QL World] </i>article was from 1987 – call it a ‘fingerprint’ error if you like!)

I saw an opportunity to use the algorithms to develop a version to map out geographical regions from Ordnance Survey maps – as a mountain biker and hiker I thought it would be interesting to show the sort of landscapes on which I was careening about! This was started sometime in late 1988, and it remained a personal project for a long while, more to give me a challenge that would keep my programming skills ticking over.

I had been writing and submitting various articles, including program listings, to <i>[Sinclair QL World]</i> over various years (I even have a letter from Editor [Helen Armstrong] regarding a series of ‘proto-articles’ as she put it, just as the publication wound up in May 1994).  I also had submitted one of my listings to the Public Domain (<i>“[Chemistry]”</i> – a periodic table tool that was printed in <i>[Sinclair QL World] </i>Sept 1990), via the PD lists handled at that time by [Richard Alexander] at [CGH Services].

It seemed natural, therefore, to work with Richard to see if <i>3DT</i> had any commercial possibilities, otherwise I might have simply adapted it into an article series for <I>[Sinclair QL World] </I>.

Fortunately, Richard agreed that it <i>“sounds a very interesting program”</i> (his note on my first submission of <i>3DT</i> v1 – at that time called <i>‘TriDT’</i>). Version 1 was completed to a point where I felt confident to show it in August 1990. At that time, it would still have been regarded very much as an ‘Alpha’ release, with rough edges, part-finished feature sets and more than a few errors, especially when used away from my trusty 128k D15 issue JS-ROMed QL – Richard was testing it on a 640K [Minerva] ROMed QL, [Minerva] 1.81 with [ToolKit 2] enabled. However, it didn’t get a ‘pre-release number’ such as we are used to seeing these days – it was probably not even worthy of a ‘v0.1’ label at that point!

Richard tested several versions up to around v1.2 before we hit a bug – using the SuperCharge SE compiler, the program exhibited several glitches that were just not present in SuperBASIC. Richard suggested that [Q-Liberator] or [Turbo] be used instead. All the [Minerva] compatibility issues had been resolved and the program was largely functional – probably now just about a ‘Beta’ release. It was then time to sort out the graphics – the basic QL LINE command often drew different lines between the same two points that did not actually go directly on top of one another...

The program was tested with [Lightning] and SpeedScreen (both software and ROM versions), and the code altered to make use of lng_GRAF_ext and lng_MATH_ext as an option – the user had to copy these to the <i>3DT</i> medium if they owned a copy, remove a few REMs from the BOOT file and the program did the rest. Because the display was becoming increasingly graphical, [Lightning] made a big difference – whilst SpeedScreen could be used without any problems, it did not speed up the rendering of images (it did speed up some of the auxiliary stuff, such as listing files on a disk or drive). SpeedScreen also did nothing for the accuracy of the LINE command, so the small glitches in the drawn surface still remained.

At around this time, Richard contacted [Simon Goodwin] and [Mike Lloyd] to make sure that we were okay to base the work on Mike’s original <i>[Sinclair QL World]</i> articles. Simon acted as intermediary to first introduce Richard and the program to Mike and made a few comments about possible improvements to the program. Mike and Richard discussed the program at length by phone. Mike freely gave his permission to use the algorithms, providing we also co-credit his wife Sue! He declined the offer of royalties, saying that was <i>“very interesting to know that someone has made further use of the program”</i> and that it was <i>“reward enough to be acknowledged in the program notes”</i>.  He noted that <i>3DT</i> had <i>“quite a lot of potential”</i> and also mentioned that coincidentally Sue’s <i>“professional training is as a land surveyor”</i> – already at that time <i>3DT</i> was demonstrated using the ‘NDALE’ data extracted from the OS data for Nidderdale in North Yorkshire, a real landscape.

[Rich Mellor] was also brought into this part-time team in May 1991, as he had advised on development of more than a few of the CGH program library. He became a co-writer of the final versions of the code, making sure that the SuperBASIC listing was optimised to make use of the [Turbo] compiler – the [Turbo Toolkit] was useful, but one of the upshots of the various improvements meant the program only just fitted into a standard 128k RAM – the 50x50 data arrays were built into the program, reserving enough memory to handle the most complex surfaces that the QL could display using its native hi-res graphics mode without the whole lot merging into a solid block. However, the program was already running with multitasking to Psion Abacus and Easel modules, and these would push the memory load to the point where at least 64K extra RAM was needed. In practice, most users would now be using memory upgrades such as [Miracle Systems] [Trump Card] or [Gold Card] – I’d already gone down the [Trump Card] route by then.

Rich’s first reply included a few corrections, but noted that he was <i>“quite impressed with the program itself – it is neat and simple, and now that it will multi-task with Easel/Abacus, good things could be in store”</i>. High praise indeed!

The QL’s display capability was also the reason why one of Mike’s suggestions wasn’t added, that of implementing full 2-point perspective using a relatively simple modification to the algorithms – it would have looked fine for small grids, but for anything above 30x30 up to the 50x50 max, the detail would have been lost as the ‘facets’ that made up the 3D surface merged towards the vanishing points. 

Development versions went up to 1.7 before it was considered ‘release-ready’ in November 1991. I wrote the final version of the manual and <i>3DT</i> was officially released in mid-1992 under the new name <i>3D Terrain</i>, over 3 years after I first began toying around with the idea. The delay was due to unforeseen circumstances from Richard’s point of view, but allowed a few final tweaks to be made, (version 1.10 was finished by Rich in Feb 1992), at which point it became v2.0, and went on sale from [CGH Services] for £12.50.

A PC version for Windows 3.11 and then Windows 95 was planned (I even dabbled in Visual BASIC and Delphi to see if it could be ported across), but since spreadsheets developed to such a point in the mid 90s where they were presenting 3D data like this more effectively, there was no demand and this version was not pursued.

The program was released as freeware in 2016 in recognition of the 30th Anniversary of [RWAP Software]

!<b>The ‘other’ <i>3D Terrain</i>...</b>

Around May or June I read an article in <i>[Sinclair QL World]</i> that happened to include a partial listing of a boot program for a program called ‘<i>3D Terrain</i>’. I initially became worried that a leak had occurred, but it was a different boot program from the one ‘my’ 3D Terrain used. Still, I told Richard, who checked around with various sources, including [Simon Goodwin], and we came to the conclusion that it was simply a coincidence. However, from what we could establish, ‘my’ 3D Terrain predated this other version by over a year – it had just taken so long to finish that the other title made the press first.

A month or so later, this other <i>3D Terrain</i> was reviewed in <i>[Sinclair QL World]</i>. It turns out that this program was of US origin and was more specialised in that it could not accept user data – it drew surfaces based on mathematical functions. As such, we felt that we had a better claim to any title with ‘Terrain’ in it, especially as the Nidderdale sample was still included, an actual terrain, and featured in every review or advert of ‘my’ version.


!!!The US version (written by Mike James and published by [Digital Precision Ltd])
This version was released at about the same time, and whilst it has more options for manipulating the display of the data, it can only process the datamaps which are supplied with the program, thus limiting its usability.  

Following a sale of the rights of the program to [Digital Precision Ltd], this version of 3D Terrain was included in the [QMaths 2] package.

!!<b>History and Development of the US Version</b> <i>(by [Mike James])</i>
This program was originally developed by me using [SuperBASIC C-Port] but I sent the program to Digital Precision for help, after I ran into problems using their C compiler. They helped me fix the very simple syntax problem, and then offered to buy it, so that the math routines I had developed could be included in their “QMATHS 2” package. 

I had come up with a way to combine "terrains" (formulas that would normally be individually plotted) as well as some randomization routines that could be overlaid over that, which is what got their interest. The software itself was basically a "math demo" for people who perhaps wanted to design terrain for games, etc.. 

Whilst this final version now compiled with [Turbo] runs much more quickly than the original, it is simple indeed, compared to the original - it originally had some randomization options, allowing users to create more variations in the plots. The original program also could take up to an hour to plot the drawings, before it was compiled with [Turbo].

!<b>Press reviews</b>

A copy of the UK version of 3D Terrain was sent for review to <i>[Sinclair QL World]</i>, and [Bryan Davies] reported back in the October 1992 edition. Bryan had also reviewed the US version earlier that year, so was in a good position to compare them.

Bryan noted that the two programs shared a name, but little else. However, he commented that the UK version of 3D Terrain <i>"feels generally faster, and is not likely to have you wandering away to do something else while the screen is redrawn"</i> and that when multitasking with other programs the screen refresh <i>"was instant with Shift-F4"</i> – a testament to the neat code and optimised routines in 3D Terrain. 

The trade-off for accuracy and speed was clear – the Nidderdale plot took seconds to draw on 3D Terrain, and yet was acceptable for most uses, compared to minutes or even hours for the much more mathematically-intensive US program.

Bryan also praised the clarity of instructions for the user, including the use of optional modules from [Lightning] (a bundled run-time version was considered during development, but eventually not included).

One of Bryan’s final comments perhaps contained more about the future than we had so far seen – <i>“The emphasis on micro software is currently very heavily on graphic presentation, and simulated three-dimensional modelling of this sort is a common business tool in business computing.”</i>

<i>The UK version of [3D Terrain]</i> has also been reviewed in <i>[QL Today]</i>, by [Jochen Merz].

wikipage: 68K/OS
wikitext: 68K/OS was originally intended as the operating system for the Sinclair QL, and was apparently the operating system demonstrated at the launch of the QL, but due to production delays, [Tony Tebby] was asked to produce QDOS, which eventually made it into the released machines

68K/OS was designed by [GST Computer Systems] and written by Tim Ward.  GST later released it as an alternative operating system for the QL, sold on a small interface which plugged into the QL's expansion port and allowed you to switch between 68K/OS and QDOS.

The system allowed access to QL multitasking, enhanced screen windowing facilities, unix-like real-time kernel including pipes and an 'extensive library of application software including full screen editor'.

The windowing facilities were also more advanced than under QDOS (or even SMSQ/e), as each task under 68K/OS has its own window that the user can shrink or expand, or even split horizontal windows vertically into further sub-windows.

The screen editor included a ruler line, and a menu window (which could be hidden, similar to the menus in Psion's [Quill], once you are happy to use commands directly).

The multi-tasking offered by 68K/OS was also much improved over QDOS, particularly with the inclusion of pipes, although these were added to QDOS with Toolkit II - although the QL had to wait for SMSQ/e and the pointer environment [QPTR] to be able to use tasks with overlapping windows quite so easily.

Unfortunately, the format used by 68K/OS for microdrives does not appear to be compatible with that used by QDOS.  That said, microdrives run more quickly than under QDOS, improving response times and program loading times. Following the initial review of 68K/OS in QL User, GST promised that a utility would be released which would allow 68K/OS to read QDOS formatted microdrive cartridges, although it is unknown whether this was ever released.

Finally, the 68K/OS included a built in menu facility which could be used from within different software, so that the user could get used to using the same control commands in all programs - again this did come to QDOS to some extent, as a result of [QMENU].

The only software which appears to have been released for use under the 68K/OS system was the [68K/ASM Assembler] and a word processor from GST.

It was replaced by removing the existing 8049 chip situated next to MDV1 on the QL motherboard and inserting this new chip in its place.

Unfortunately, side effects such as affecting the use of modems connected to QL serial port blighted this device, although it achieved its aims of improving the keyboard bounce problems.

wikipage: Abacus
wikitext: Abacus was the first spreadsheet package written by [Psion] and packaged with the Sinclair QL home computer.  The US version of the software was simply called 'Spreadsheet'

Abacus used the same friendly menu driven interface familiar to users of the other Psion business programs, [Quill], [Archive] and [Easel] and you could import data between all four programs.

Abacus can handle complex equations and large amounts of data, although it has since been superceded by [QSpread] as spreadsheet programs have turned into much more complex programs offering a much wider range of functions.

Abacus was developed originally on a VAX mainframe in 1983 in C by Colly Myers. Tested on some of the in-house 'rack-based' development versions of the QL, the software had to be reduced in size using a 'table-language' developed by Psion, in order to ensure that the programs could fit within the QL's memory and microdrive cartridges.

In common with the other Psion business programs, the main problem with Abacus was that it grabs all of the QL's available memory, thus making it difficult to multi-task with the other programs (even on expanded systems).  This was resolved by programs such as [CHOice] and [QL Switch].

Abacus was also included as part of the [Xchange] package.

Work on the four Psion office packages [Quill], [Archive], Abacus and [Easel] started about 18 months prior to the QL's launch in January 1984.  Originally developed on a VAX minicomputer, discussions began between Psion and Sinclair Research about developing it for the QL.  The software was therefore developed in a way which allowed it to be ported to various machines and processors (eventually it was released for the Sinclair QL, the IBM PC, Graduate, ICL One Per Desk, Merline Tonto, Apricot and Sirius computers).

Coding actually commenced in April 1983 and in late summer 1983, Psion were given a rack-based development QL to begin the work of testing - although Psion had to use their own 'table-language' to reduce the size of the code in order to get it to fit on a standard QL's 90K RAM.

It was this table-language which led to a lot of criticism over the original v1 Psion programs, which had to be loaded in parts from microdrive during use.

v2.00 of the software was released in March 1985, which was programmed in native 68000 machine code, providing a much needed speed boost and leaving more room in memory.

wikitext: The ABC Harddisk Interface was one of the few hard-disk solutions released for the Sinclair QL.

Manufactured by [ABC Elektronic] it plugged into the QL's expansion port, and included a through connector to allow other interfaces to be plugged into it.  A special version was required for use with the [Trump Card].

Unusually, this also included a slot for IBM PC/XT compatible interfaces connected via a 35cm ribbon cable.  The interface claimed to handle most interfaces except graphics and memory cards.  A OMTI 5520 or SEAGATE ST11 harddisk controller could be attached to allow most of the 20 and 40MB harddisks with a standard ST506 interface to be used with the QL.

The software could even drive two hard disk drives at the same time.

[The Adventure] - based on the Crowther and Woods Original%%%
[Mordon's Quest] - a sequel to The Adventure

The Adventure was also released by Abersoft as Adventure 1 for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and ZX81 computers and as Classical Adventure for the Commodore 64.

Interestingly, there was an Abersoft Limited still trading from Aberystwyth as recently as 2009/10 - however, that company was only set up in 1991, so it is unknown whether there is any link between these two companies (there are no entries on Companies House for any other Abersoft Limited).

Their only program for the Sinclair QL was the program [QL Cash Trader].

I quote Keith Punshon, one of the authors:

^^''The orignial program was intended for the Epson HX-20 with, if I remember 8 lines by 80 characters wide so navigation was an extreme problem. In order to get round this I invented a system where the operator used the arrow keys to navigate various lists and selected the item he wanted.'' ^^

^^''This might sound like an obvious thing now, but back then, no one did it !! ''^^

^^''When the Epson deal collapsed, we rewrote it for the PC but we kept the 8 x 80 screen entry which left us with some room on the screen''.^^

^^''We used this for showing reports at the top of the screen which immediately  reflected any entry made''. ^^

^^''Sinclair Research liked the look and feel of our product and made us an offer to sell it under the QL banner  Incidently they showed our software to other software houses suggesting they adopt the look and feel of ours.'' ^^

^^''You might notice it is very similar to Sage Software's look and feel, who were one of the companies shown it!! Enough said ! ''^^

^^''We eventually sold our company to [Quest Automation Ltd] and remained with them for 18 months or so. Since then I have never seen a reference to the software, but I do still have an original copy of the QL discs( tapes ) and manual.'' ^^

A.C.T (otherwise known as the Adventure Creation Tool) was initially published under the name A.P.T. (Adventure Programming Tool) by Shadow Games.

The author, Steve Sutton, then struck a new deal and it was re-released as A.C.T. and published by Digital Precision.

ACT is a modular based program that combines a number of small packages that combine to create graphical text adventures. Modules included a sound and graphics designer.

The program was advertised in QL World August 1988 with the following information:

"The Adventure Creation Tool enables the user - who need not know how to program - to create the most amazing adventures, with text, pictures and animation. A disk drive is needed".

There still remains a lot of interest in this package, and we would love to contact Steve Sutton to get it re-released.

ACT generates stand-alone executable programs, which contains the complete generated adventure, including graphics.

As an interest aspect, ACT is able to generate code which can display Mode 8 and Mode 4 in the same time on the screen, the upper half in Mode 4, the lower half in Mode 8, all done in machine code. This may show, what is possible with the QL.

The program also allows you to change registers and memory locations on the fly, for debugging the completed program.

The advertised features included:

*Full 68000 macro assembler
*Integrated full screen editor
*Conditional assembly
*External library file inclusion
*Complete error checking diagnostics
*Comprehensive manual

It appears to only work in 128K unfortunately.

Pressing H from within the assembly brings up a short help file explaining the various commands available, which include the ability to list a file with hexcodes, lock or unlock the Symbol table, and dump an area of memory

Adder Publishing Limited was founded in 1984 by Adrian Dickens after graduating with an Electrical Sciences degree from Churchill College at Cambridge University. 

Adder did however, also publish some of their own software titles for the QL including:

*[Adder Assembler] - a full blown 68008 assembler for producing machine code on the QL.
*[QDoctor] - a utility to recover data from corrupt microdrive cartridges

The Company is still trading and was re-branded [Adder Technology Limited|http://www.adder.com] in 1986, at which point its focus changed to providing solutions for clients wishing to connect different elements of their computer operations (computer connectivity). Originally the company started with boxes for sharing printers between several computers, which came before the mass deployment of networks, then moved on to producing various networking products.

The Company is still run by Adrian Dickens and his brother, Nigel.

wikipage: Advanced Development Toolkit
wikitext: The Advanced Development Toolkit was designed to work together with either [UCSD Pascal] or [UCSD Fortran-77].

Both programs generate code which runs on a new operating system for the QL (the p-System).

This toolkit provided a range of productivity tools, such as a symbolic debugger, native code generator and program analysis tools.

Included with the program were manuals on Applications Development, Program Development and the Internal Architecture Guide.

This toolkit would even allow you to edit the source files for the p-System, re-assemble them and then reconfigure the system as you need.  One of the main things missing is the ability to move files between the standard QL (QDOS) file system and the p-System itself (the p-System stores all of its files in one large container (file) called psystem on a QL floppy disk or microdrive cartridge, similar to how many emulators store QL files on a PC (in a QXL.WIN file today).

The commentary in QL User (August 1985) suggests that TDI Software were working on this, but it is unknown if it was ever produced.

wikitext: Amadeus Interlink was produced by [Di-Ren] and was a token ring local network system designed to connect various types of computer and I/O interface at low cost.

Up to 255 modules could be connected to the system, with each module being housed in a small box enclosure measuring about 110x60x30mm and up to 10 metres network cable between interfaces (although this could be extended up to 50 metres with RX and TX line drivers added to the cable).

The modules we know of that were produced were:

!!!QL Controller Module
This plugged into the QL's ROM port and optionally provided a through port connector.  This allowed the QL to connect via cables to the other modules.

!!!Centronics Controller Module
This allowed computers to connect to the network using a bi-directional centronics port, as normally found on PCs.  Software for the PC to link to the network over this device was produced, with Amiga software in development as at June 1995.

!!!Centronics Interface Module
This provided a bi-directional centronics port on the system, so it could be used either to connect to parallel (centronics) printers, or use as a high speed net-link type interface (using a Lap-Link cable).

!!!Ama-Sound Module
This allowed computers to record and play back sound, using 12 bit sampling and ADPCM algorithm for high audio quality, with sample speeds between 4kHz and 8kHz (4 bits) and came complete with a microphone, speaker and either QL or PC software.

A high speed RS232c network interface was said to be in development


We have saved the PC and QL software for the Centronics Controller and QL Controller - we are missing the software for the Ama-Sound.

__Amadeus Protocol__ software was also said to be under development which would allow file server type operations between any type of linked computer, as well as the ability to pass system calls to other computers.

wikitext: Anelpum Quat was a cryptic text adventure published by CGH Services. The game is unusual for a number of reasons, the main title is an anagram of Quantum Leap while the game itself is set inside your QL which has all kinds of things wrong that need repairing. Anelpum Quat also uses a parser system which checks the letter as you type meaning that you can only type words that the system allows.

Aquanaut 471 is a text adventure (with pictures for each location) produced by [Microdeal] for the Sinclair QL and is unusual in that not only does it include graphics for each of the locations, but when you get to certain points of the game, there is a mini-arcade game which you need to complete.

In this game, you play the role of Aquanaut 471, a member of the Oceanic Federation tasked with keeping the peace in the underwater world and are in charge of a submarine which has been sent to investigate what has happened at an underwater base.  As you near the base, you can feel the effects of the explosion and need to investigate - get to the base before the air on your submarine runs out.

There are several mini arcade games which must be completed once you are at the underwater base, which, although fairly basic, add a different dimension to the game.

Advertised features include:
*Full text and graphic adventure
*100+ graphic locations in full colour
*3 strategic arcade games
*Realistic sound effects
*Animated help from robot 'Huey'
*Save load game feature
*Single stroke entry of keywords

The program was also released on the Dragon 32/64 and the TRS-80 CoCo computers as Major Istar, Under the Doomed Sea.

wikipage: ArcEd
wikitext: A text editor written in 1989 by Steen Kastoft Hansen of Denmark. First marketed by Dansoft/Thor International.

ArcEd, at last an editor especially designed for writing programs! It was intended as the programmers editor.
- Assembler
- SuperBASIC
- Pascal, C
- Lisp etc.
All are supported through auto indenting, block indenting, parenthesis check, configurable word delimiters and batch files.

After the collapse of the Thor business, Steen handed over the product including the source code to [Urs Koenig] of [COWO Electronic].

In January 1998 Urs Koenig declared ArcEd and other [COWO Electronic] software packages as freeware. The software was then submitted as is to [Gerhard Plavec] for inclusion on the QL-PD/CD-R, the first of many QL related [CD-ROMs].

wikipage: ArchDEV/ArchRTM
wikitext: ArchDEV/RTM was a software suite released by [Psion] for people wishing to create software using the power of the programming language and database facilities provided by QL [Archive].

ArchDEV was the program for creating the programs, and protecting the code.

ArchRTM was then a freely distributable runtime module, which was required to link in and run the finished program, subject to a license fee of £1 per copy sold being paid to Psion.  

ArchRTM provided various advantages to software developers:

- Smaller footprint than [Archive], running more quickly on the QL
- More memory available for programs and databases
- Automatically loads and runs an Archive program, which then controls the full QL screen
- The program is protected, and cannot be broken into by users
- The memory split between ArchRTM (or RTM Archive) and QDOS can be tuned to get the best out of your program


A number of commercial packages were released using this development package, including:

* [Archivist] - A collection database program by [Ark Distribution]
* [Cardfile] - An easy to use cardfile database by [Ark Distribution]
* [Mailfile] - A mailing database by [Ark Distribution]
* [Librarian] - A database for maintaining a library by [Ark Distribution]
* [IMPACCT] - An accounting package by [Xpert Software]
* [Stock Control] - Stock Control system by [Transform]
* [QL Mail List] - Program to maintain a mailing list by [Transform]

wikipage: Archive
wikitext: Archive was the first programmable database package written by [Psion] and packaged with the Sinclair QL home computer.  The US version of the software was simply called 'Database'

Archive used the same friendly menu driven interface familiar to users of the other Psion business programs, [Quill], [Abacus] and [Easel] and you could import data between all four programs.  However, Archive was slightly different in that it did not operate by single key presses for commands - you had to type the command in full

Archive was perhaps the most complex of all four Psion programs - with its own programming language, which meant that not only could you quickly and easily set up a card file like database, but you could program your own routines for handling and processing / validating data as it was entered, as well as define screen layouts.

In fact, a version of Archive was released specifically for creating your own stand-alone database programs - [ArchDEV/ArchRTM].

Archive was developed originally on a VAX mainframe in 1983 in C by Charles Davies. Tested on some of the in-house 'rack-based' development versions of the QL, the software had to be reduced in size using a 'table-language' developed by Psion, in order to ensure that the programs could fit within the QL's memory and microdrive cartridges.

In common with the other Psion business programs, the main problem with Archive was that it grabs all of the QL's available memory, thus making it difficult to multi-task with the other programs (even on expanded systems).  This was resolved by programs such as [CHOice] and [QL Switch].  

Archive did however also suffer from two other problems, in that if you exited the program (or the QL crashed) without you closing the database, then you had to use a third party tool to recover the database.  Archive also did not allow you to add additional fields to a database once it was set up.

Archive was also included as part of the [Xchange] package.

Work on the four Psion office packages [Quill], Archive, [Abacus] and [Easel] started about 18 months prior to the QL's launch in January 1984.  Originally developed on a VAX minicomputer, discussions began between Psion and Sinclair Research about developing it for the QL.  The software was therefore developed in a way which allowed it to be ported to various machines and processors (eventually it was released for the Sinclair QL, the IBM PC, Graduate, ICL One Per Desk, Merline Tonto, Apricot and Sirius computers).

Coding actually commenced in April 1983 and in late summer 1983, Psion were given a rack-based development QL to begin the work of testing - although Psion had to use their own 'table-language' to reduce the size of the code in order to get it to fit on a standard QL's 90K RAM.

It was this table-language which led to a lot of criticism over the original v1 Psion programs, which had to be loaded in parts from microdrive during use.

v2.00 of the software was released in March 1985, which was programmed in native 68000 machine code, providing a much needed speed boost and leaving more room in memory.

Area Radar Controller is a simulation by [Shadow Games] of a busy Air Traffic Control centre - you are placed in control of up to 69 aircraft in a busy air traffic zone, with 2 airfields and 9 runways.

You need to ensure that the planes do not collide or run out of fuel on their journeys.

Unfortunately, the game is quite poor graphics wise, but still quite compelling.

wikipage: Arrakis
wikitext: Arrakis were a small software company which produced a couple of games for the Sinclair QL in the early days - their games were published by [Sinclair Research Ltd].

The programs were written by Steve Hollywood and Ian B Williams, who were in their teens at the time.  The name Arrakis was from the film Dune which had been released as a film around that time.

The games were:

*[Orbit] (An orbital fighting game with realistic orbital physics)
*[QL Jabber] (A platform game)
*[QL Meteor Storm] (Based on the classic Asteroids Arcade Game)

A further game, Recconaisance, written by Ian Kennedy, Ian Williams and Steven Hollywood was published in the [February 1986 issue of Computer and Video Games|https://archive.org/stream/computer-video-games-magazine-052/CVG052_Feb_1986#page/n117/mode/2up]

Steven Hollywood & Ian Williams also wrote a machine code routine to play music on the QL which was published in the [October 1986 issue of Sinclair QL World|http://sinclairql.speccy.org/archivo/docs/mags/QLWorld_1986-10.pdf].

Steve also believes that there were a couple of other articles, including, a basic version of something like the Atari missile command and a series of several articles that programmed a space invader type game in 68K assembler. This latter has been confirmed as being Paladin available on [the Sinclair QL Homepage|http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/games/]

Ian Williams and Steven also wrote some articles for another magazine but tended to focus on QL World / QL User.

wikitext: Assault & Battery is an excellent arcade game written by [Damon Chaplin] and originally published under the name [KAOS Software].  It was later re-released by [CGH Services] and is now public domain.

This game places you in control of an aircraft attacking an enemy base - you need to destroy enemy tanks and jets as they scroll towards you, whilst avoiding the gun emplacements (which can rotate or move up and down the screen).

As you fly, if you destroy certain enemy objects, you will receive additional firepower and fuel to help you in your quest.

Excellent graphics and not easy to complete.

wikipage: Astracom Modems
wikitext: The Astracom 1000 modem for the QL was originally sold by Astracom, Strong Computers and TF Services. It came with QL software and a serial cable for £198 (1986 prices).

The modem featured autodial, autoanswer and printer control facilities (Centronics interface). It covered all the standards necessary for European communications networks at the time, and could be upgraded for use with American Bell networks.

The onboard processor handled all handshaking and buffering necessary for the QL, along with modem and printer functions for auto-dialling and auto-answer.

Modes available included 300/300, 1200/75, 75/1200 and 1200/1200, but in auto scan the modem could set its own baudrate by sensing the returned carrier tone.

Additionally the Astracom 1000 could perform equalisation to improve poor lines, use the centronics priner interface while on line, and generate even parity and local echo for half duplex communications.

The communications software for the QL included a 40-column colour videotex emulator for Prestel, and a 40/80 column terminal for non-videotex services. A more advanced package called QTERM with XMODEM file transfer capability was also developed.  TF Services sold Tony Price's QL Terminal. TF Services also developed a V22bis upgrade board.

wikipage: Aurora
wikitext: The Aurora motherboard was a replacement for the standard Sinclair QL motherbaord, designed by [Zeljko Nastasic] and marketed by [Qubbesoft]. 

Although the Aurora lacked a processor (it was designed for use with a [Gold Card] or [Super Gold Card]), it was ideally suited for use in a PC case, as it allowed you to connect to either a standard QL monitor, a VGA or an SVGA monitor (or even an LCD controller board).

As well as the standard QL display modes, Aurora also supports up to 768 x 576 pixel displays at 256 colours, which can be accessed either directly, or through using the SMSQ/e operating system.  Two chips were taken from the original QL - the 8302 ULA and the 8049 co-processor.

The Aurora allows you to connect various ROMs for operating systems (including standard QL ROMs, [Minerva] MK1 or Minerva MK2) and even a 512K 27050 or 27C040 EPROM.

Standard PC connectors are on the motherboard to allow you to attach the following:

a) Reset button, power and network LEDs, speaker and network adaptor lead
b) An Atari / Amiga BUS mouse (not serial / PS/2)
c) 2 x DB-9 or DB-25 serial ports
d) External power connector (although the Aurora was normally powered through a powered backplane).

You could add more connectivity by using a [Minerva] MK2 operating system and/or [SuperHermes] in place of a standard 8049 processor.

An extended ROM port connector is also provided which (with a suitable adaptor) allows you to either use standard QL ROM cartridges (and other devices), or an extended ROM connector which included a further 7 signals (so far as we know, no hardware was ever produced to utilise this).

Finally most people used a replacement keyboard interface built into an 8049 replacement (SuperHERMES, the Di-Ren keyboard interface, or Jürgen Falkenberg interface), although the Aurora does include a Keyboard matrix connector which accepted a special adaptor which would enable a standard QL keyboard membrane to be used.

wikipage: Bandersnatch
wikitext: Bandersnatch is one of the few mysteries which surround Sinclair QL software and remains something of a legend.

It was originally designed by Imagine (Name of the Game) and was being written at around the time of the collapse of this company. 

Bandersnatch was to be the first of a series of megagames produced by Imagine, which were designed to push the boundaries of the hardware of the time, even to the extent that they were intended to be released for the ZX Spectrum, with a hardware add-on which would have increased the capabilities of the computer.

A new company called Finchspeed was set-up after Imagine folded which then sold the rights to the game to Sinclair Research Ltd, who were insistent that it should work on the QL from microdrives without extra hardware. It is rumoured that a complete working version was then developed for the Sinclair QL before Finchspeed (or was it called Fireiron?) too folded. 

The directors of Finchspeed, Dave Lawson and Ian Heatherington then went on to form Psygnosis and the game was later released for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST as Brataccas.

Baron Rouge was a Sinclair QL game produced by the Belgian software house, Labochrome.

In this game, you play the part of the Red Baron from World War I (Manfred Albrecht Freiherr von Richthofen) in his battle against enemy fighters.

Your plane is a monoplane - starting on the right hand side of the screen, with the enemy flying at you from the left.  You need to shoot them down to get past wave after wave of enemy planes, airships and more (including hang-gliders, fish on skateboards and winged horses!).

The action is furious with good graphics, and there was both a French and an English version of the game.

wikipage: Bill Richardson
wikitext: Bill Richardson was one of the much loved characters associated with the Sinclair QL, and well known from his attendance at QL shows during the 1980s and 90s.

Bill Richardson's career spanned many decades, but he was best known as running [EEC Limited] and then [WN Richardson & Co]. 

The following obituary was written for Bill Richardson by [Tony Firshman] following his death in 2013:

>William Newall Richardson sadly died on January 3rd, 2013 aged 94.

>Most of us will have known him or purchased from the company he ran after his fourth "retirement" in the mid 80s.

>He did eventually retire and lived his many remaining years in a magnificent sheltered apartment in Luton.  I visited him there for lunch very many times with Vic Gerhardi (Z88 trader).  We even had a day out to Southend in 2011 with Vic, his friend Denise and his father.  They all have some degree of physical disability and used sticks.  Bill also was frail, walked very slowly, and with a stick if he could be persuaded to use it.  We had some hilarious slow convoys in and out of establishments. We all crammed into the smallest of the many Southend Rossi establishments, blocking it completely and ate ice creams, messily.  The pier directly opposite was closed as a barge had hit it the previous night. Sadly our 2013 trip was to take Bill to the end of the pier.

>Bill was born on April 18, 1918 in East Riggs on the Solway Firth.  As his daughter Sue puts it, slightly tongue in cheek: "This of course makes him Scottish".  His family though soon moved to Swinton in Lancashire, where he went to school.  I did not know this, and it explains the lack of a Scottish accent!  His retirement project was to write a book on the history of the Scots.  Sadly, when I offered to proof read, I saw it had not got beyond the introduction page.

>Many will remember the tartan cloth covering his stall at QL shows.

>He excelled in mathematics at school and studied Electrical and Mechanical Engineering at Salford Technical College now (of course) part of the University of Salford (Peel building). It is a magnificent Victorian edifice reminiscent of the Natural History Museum in London.

>He spent the second world war in Gosport and Southend doing engineering work for the Royal Navy.

>He married Dorothy in 1947, and his daughter Sue was born in 1948.  They moved to 6 Ravensmead, Chalfont St Peter, Bucks in 1952 and Nick was born five years later.

>I remember 6 Ravensmead and Dorothy very well. I visited his home many times to share a car to QL shows, and to discuss QL and Z88 projects. After Dorothy died in 2004, I also did quite a bit of work on his house and garden.  He bought a plot of land in the 50s, built the road and his magnificent large detached house at the end.  I believe he was also an instrumental part of the housing development there.

>He had a long and varied business career. He retired three times, according to his daughter, because he always got bored with gardening and golf, and Dorothy got fed up with him being at home!

>Bill worked for a number of international companies including Plessey, GEC and Hughes Aircraft Company.  He started the first of his own semi-conductor distribution businesses which he sold in 1969 and "retired" for the first time. His last job as an employee before his second "retirement" was marketing director of Chubb. Shortly after that he re-emerged as the managing director of an international legal publishing company. Following his third "retirement", he started his own software and book publishing company called Oxford Computer Publishing (OCP) from an old house in Dell's Secondhand Car Lot in Chalfont St Peter. I saw those premises, and it was not quite the "Arthur Daly" place his daughter likes to call it!  His fourth "retirement" came when he closed OCP.  However it resurrected as [EEC Limited] and [WN Richardson & Co] and it is this that most of us will remember him for.

>Many will remember his son Nick accompanying him to QL shows, when he needed help with the sheer weight of his product.

>He did remarkable work for the QL and Z88 scene from the mid 80s.  He had many contacts with Sinclair Research and Cambridge Computing (Z88) when they were active. When both companies ceased trading he procured a great deal of their stock.  This allowed his colleague Felix Fonteyn (brother of [Dame Margot|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_Fonteyn]) and others to assemble effectively new QLs in original packaging.  He sold thousands of these.  He also arranged for production of 5000 QL membranes from the original manufacturer.  Such was his generosity, he split the batch with me and charged me cost only.  I also made a lot of products for him for the Z88 and QL.  One memorable job was to make 100 Microdrive extension leads. These were with ribbon cable that could be twisted so that Spectrum drives faced forward. It was immensely hard sourcing the necessary edge connectors, which had to be custom made in the USA.  Unfortunately he mislaid the finished product. I remember searching a number of times in the piles of stock around his house.  We never found them. I did though find plenty of things even he did not realise he had, like a huge pile of 8301 chips - much in demand then, and scarce.  I often wonder whether the Microdrive leads emerged when he sold his home.

>One thing I will always be grateful to Bill for is the introduction to Vic Gerhardi (Rakewell Ltd) who trades with the Z88.  Vic was considering a flash memory card for the Z88 and Bill suggested me as the pcb designer and manufacturer. That was in the early 90s, and Vic has since become not only a business colleague, but a very good friend.  I showed the flash card for the Z88 to Stuart Honeyball (Miracle Systems) at an Eindhoven show.  We travelled back together, and by the time we reached England we had mapped out RomDisq.  So indirectly Bill was even responsible for RomDisq!  I don't think I ever told him that.

>In his latter years, after Dorothy died, I am told Bill took to going on cruises.  These were regarded with great trepidation by his family, as he was always joking about getting married again.  His son Nick accompanied him on these adventures.  This was very brave of him, I am told, as Bill's last travelling companion had been "mislaid" in the Arctic Circle. Nick would hold him in check, vet any lady friends, and smooth over the chaos that seemed to follow him everywhere.  This came as a great surprise to me as I had never seen this side of his character.  From this and other things his family have said, he sounded a great deal of fun.  I wish I had seen more of that side of him.

>He was very lucky to live a very full, active and healthy long life.

>He will be sorely missed.

BJ In 3D Land was the last game to feature the character "BJ".  All three games were written by [Janko Mrsic-Flögel], two published by [Eidersoft] and the first by [Sinclair Research Ltd]. The previous two were [QL Cavern] and [BJ Returns].

As the title implies, BJ is lost in a fiendish 3D stepped maze. Gather the diamonds to earn points, or the energy-giving squares to prevent the game ending when BJ runs out of energy. Monsters roam the maze, draining BJ of energy when they bump into him. 

Controlled by cursor keys or a joystick plugged into the CTL1 port.

BJ Returns (also known as "BJ The Return" and "QL Cavern 2") is one of the three "BJ" games by [Janko Mrsic-Flögel], published by Eidersoft. The other two were [QL Cavern] and [BJ In 3D Land]

Colourful and action-packed, this game follows the death of Drunx, leaving BJ helpless in the caverns after his previous adventure. Escape is impossible unless he satisfies the fairy Matilda by collecting all of the miracles from the cave.

Eidersoft claimed that this used much more complex graphics than [QL Cavern] and was twice as fast, with a spectacular ending.  Eidersoft ran a competition offering £500 worth of computer equipment to the first person to complete the game.

A small BASIC routine to patch the program to give BJ infinite lives was published in QL World August 1986, page 15. The author was Peter Dampier. From the specific addresses and so on, it looks like this patch might only work on 128K systems (untested):

There are 50 caverns to explore, with the game running to some 50 screens. In its time, this was described by Jason Ball in QL World magazine as "without doubt one of the best arcade games for the QL."

__ATTACK!!__ - An arcade game where you have to protect planet earth from alien spaceships%%%
__CODE-CRACKER__ A puzzle game where you have to crack the code on a vital combination lock%%%
__ISLAND__ Manage an island economy and fight off invaders.%%%

wikitext: Booty was mentioned in the news section of QL User, November 1985 as being due shortly for release.

Booty is a conversion from the [ZX Spectrum game Booty|http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0000633], being a platform game set on a pirate ship, where the player has to pick up in sequence a number of keys to open a treasure chest.

Another game, 'Grin Wars' was to be included on the microdrive cartridge also.

Unfortunately, it is unknown if this program ever made it to market.

I wonder if this is the game referred to as "Botty" in the 4Systems advert in the December 1985, with a price of £9.90 ?  We shall never know, as it was dropped in their next advert.

This version of Breakout was reviewed in QL User December 1985.  It features one ot two-player options, with variable ball speed and angle adn three moving walls.  As with the Sinclair version, the screen was split into two, with about half used for the playing area, and the rest of the screen showing the scores for the two players and the highest score so far.


!!!Sinclair Version of Breakout
The version of Breakout supplied with the QL, was an excellent implementation of the basic arcade game.  You had 3 bats (lives) to score as many points as possible.  Different coloured bricks scored different amount of points.  Every so often the rows of bricks would descend a level and they may change colour to a lower scoring value.

They produced a small range of software:
*[Last Line Recall]
*[On-line SuperBASIC Manual]
*[Real-Windows]
*[Snapshot]
*[Spooler]

Their advert also stated that their software was provided with a free hi resolution screen dump (dumps the screen to printer at the touch of a key) and a small toolkit of 8 extra SuperBASIC commands, providing GETN and GETS (edit variables on screen), MCUR (move the cursor), TAB (move the cursor to a given tab mark), FONT (reset the font address), RMODE (read the current display mode), DUMP (dump one or more lines to the printer) and BVAR (return the address of SuperBASIC variables).

wikipage: Bright Star Modem
wikitext: The Bright Star Modem was originally designed and produced during 1985 by [Commpak Data] and was sold as the __QL COMMPAK__ multi standard acoustic modem and printer controller at a price of £140.

The original QL COMMMPAK modem connected via a 25 way D connector to SER2 and allowed you to connect a phone handset for simple connection.  It included 'QL terminal emulation software' for a further £5 (unless you provided your own microdrive cartridge).  Details of that original software are unknown.

The modem also incorporated a centronics interface for connection to a Centronics-compatible parallel printer.

The modem was then re-designed to incorporate a telephone connector (rather than needing the handset to be plugged into it), and manufacturing taken over by [Modem House], with the price in August 1985 increasing to £179.95, complete with software (previously the software was supplied separately).  It was supplied in a large black case - 7 inches wide, 8 inches deep and 3 inches high. 

The external modem allowed incoming data to be spooled to a microdrive or direct to the printer and supported 300/300, 1200/75 and 1200/1200 baud, with V21 and V23 or Bell 103/113 specifications.  The 1200/1200 mode used 'packet' techniques to avoid collisions and allowed fast data transfer between two users with the same modem.

The software was said to be easy to use, without any need to select baud rates or parity, and with one program ([QLTALK]) dedicated to message services and bulletin boards, and another program ([QLPRESTEL]) dedicated to Prestel and information services, was user friendly.

The modem connected to the QL via ser2, and nothing could be connected to SER1 at the same time, although traditionally as these ports were used for a modem (ser1) and a printer (ser2) both of which are provided for within this one unit, this did not cause too many issues.

The modem also incorporated a Automatic Scan mode, where it would scan the incoming signal over the telephone system and select the right mode and protocols for communicating with the connected device.

The July 1985 issue of QL User promised that an auto-answer, auto-dial version would be released soon - it is unknown if this ever made it to market.

wikipage: C1 Forth
wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/C1_Forth-packaging.jpg|Computer One Forth for Sinclair QL|align="I"|Packaging for Sinclair QL Computer One Forth))%%%

Computer One Forth was released by [Computer One Ltd], to provide an implementation of the high-level language Forth.

Forth was developed originally by Charles Moore in the 1960s to help him control large telescopes in his observatory and is noted for its speed and reverse Polish notation (eg. to get the sum of 3 and 2 you enter:
3 2 +

Forth is also noted for files being developed as a series of pages - basically, you keep defining functions until you reach the simplest level of function - making the language probably the most modular programming language.

C1 Forth was developed with the help of Steve Pelc, an experienced Forth programmer who previously implemented the language for computers such as the Apple II.

Listed features:
* FORTH-83 SYSTEM
* Forth Screen Editor
* 100-page Manual
* Produce stand-alone programs
* QL Graphics and sound extensions
* Example FORTH programs
* FORTH macro-assembler
* Multitasking extensions with many powerful features

During 2011 a Forth programmer identified some bugs in version 2.0 of C1 Forth and has released a patch to fix these issues.

The most serious bug affected all the words that implemented some kind of integer division ( / mod /mod ... etc), where division of negative numbers yielded a quotient of 0 (rather than 
have been -1). 

The other two bugs rectified by this patch are:

"NOT" in Forth83 is defined as the "bitwise negation" of a 16 bits number, whereas in this release, it behaved like "0=", a boolean test. 

"D+!" is a word that which produced garbage.

A brief discussion with Stephen Pelc of [MicroProcessor Engineering Ltd] has elicited the following information about the program:

>The Forth was a port of the Laboratory Microsystems Inc (LMI) Forth for the 68K. This was then ported to the CP/M 68K by Joe Barnhart (of Cerebral Engineering), and the copyright probably still belongs to Ray Duncan (of LMI). Laboratory Microsystems now appears to be closed, and Ray Duncan has returned to working as a doctor.

>The Forth development was done on a Sage II under CP/M 68k. As at August 2016, the hardware still exists and is still owned by Stephen Pelc. The floppy discs for the Sage and the Computer One development source are somewhere in the building, but he was unable to find them. The QL itself was from the second batch of development machines and was given away a long time ago.

>Stephen states that he did find a small portion of the source as paper listings on fanfold paper which contain copyright notices from MPE, Cerebral Engineering and LMI. MPE stopped dealing with LMI in the mid 1980s.

Computer One Monitor is a simple multitasking monitor/disassembler which forms a good tool for machine code 
programmers to help with their debugging.

It usefully allows you to create multiple windows on screen to perform different monitoring tasks at the same time.  You could add a channel number to the end of each command to send output to a different window.

Advertised features included:
*Ability to disassemble, dump, search, alter, move, compare memory, display registers, dump registers at end of trace
*Catches address trap errors, illegal instructions
*5 different window displays, allowing disassembly, tracing, dumping and register display on screen at the same time
*Basic like commands for full window/channel control, allowing output to any device
*Full job control - load, stop, suspend and alter priority.  
*Ability to monitor several jobs and display information about all current jobs.
*Special facility to make monitor commands into separate jobs, giving continuous picture of progress.
*Assembles code on the fly directly from the Monitor

The later version of this software included full symbolic debugging, v.2.0 already has some hints in the code to this feature

v2.00 of this Monitor has been preserved and made available as freeware, thanks to the author. 

The version available from the Sinclair QL Homepage is slightly patched from the original (modified to work under the Pointer Environment, small background job added that continuously checks the integrity of the Monitor itself)

wikipage: C1 Pascal
wikitext: Computer One Pascal is an implementation of the classic programming language.

PASCAL (named after the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal) was designed in 1968/9 and published in 1970 by Niklaus Wirth as a small and efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring.  Each variable has to be associated with a type (such as CHAR, INTEGER or REAL), but copying between data types generally causes an error, limiting the language's flexibility.

Pascal's ability to enumerate types and form complex data structures makes it suitable for structured data processing and arithmetic, algorithmic problems.

The Computer One version of Pascal compiles source code into a compact interpretive code (P-code - as with [USCD Pascal]), resulting in small programs, although you need to have the interpreter loaded from the Pascal system in order to run these programs (limiting the ability to distribute the final programs).

Advertised features included:
*Full-screen editor
*QL graphics and sound extensions
*Example programs
*Complete 87 page user guide
*Full implementation close to ISO-standard
*Typically 15x faster than BASIC

The former owner of Computer One Limited has now agreed to make this software available as freeware.

According to one source, this was basically typed in from an existing C listing for a Pascal compiler..

When the program first starts, there is a rather poor representation of the QL keyboard shown on screen and takes you slowly through finding the space, escape and return keys, and then using the home and outer keys (although no mention is made as to what the home keys are used for!)

Alas the program does not allow you to save your score in order to try and better it in the future and neither does it actually calculate your typing speed when entering sentences.

CAD PAK is a bitmap drawing program produced by [Datalink Systems (Wales)] which was controlled through a series of icons.  

It appears to be an updated version of the earlier [M-Paint] - we have seen two versions of this program, one of which continues to be in SuperBASIC (c) 1984, and a later version which was compiled with [Q-liberator] (c) 1986.

Interestingly, [Sandy] had released another version of the program [CADPAK] in 1985 which was packaged with the [SuperQMouse] interface. 

Both versions of this program moved away from the _pic file suffix for pictures to a _draw file suffix.

Quite a neat utility, this provides the most common commands you require. Only handles the standard QL 4 colour screen mode.  Alas it cannot handle 512 x 256 pixels and can only handle (384 x 182 pixels) meaning that screens are only 23296 bytes in length (compared to the normal 32768 bytes).  

However, the screens can be loaded directly to the QL's screen memory although they only show as 216 lines of pixels, rather than the original 256 lines.  The 384 pixel display by the program is given stippled grey edges on either side.

It appears to be an updated version of the earlier [M-Paint], compiled with Q-liberator and packaged with the [SuperQMouse] interface, with a small inbuilt machine code extension to use Pointer Interface routines (no Window Manager routines) to control the program with the mouse and to restore the main window while using the pull down menus.

Quite a neat utility, this provides the most common commands you require. Only handles the standard QL 4 colour screen mode.  Alas it cannot handle 512 x 256 pixels and can only handle (384 x 182 pixels) meaning that screens are only 23296 bytes in length (compared to the normal 32768 bytes).

wikitext: The Care Electronics Printer Interface was a serial to parallel printer interface, which included a switch to allow operation at 75,300,600,1200,2400,4800 and 9600 baud.

This was a useful innovation, as (without [Minerva] and [SuperHERMES]), both of the QL's serial ports operate at the same baud rate, meaning that you could not easily use a printer at the same time as other serial equipment (such as a modem).

The Care Electronics Printer Interface was supplied in a black plastic case with a cable to the QL, and a second cable to the printer.

wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/cartridgedoctor_package.jpg|Talent Cartridge Doctor for Sinclair QL|align="I"|Packaging for Sinclair QL Cartridge Doctor))%%%
Published by [Talent Computer Systems], Cartridge Doctor aided the recovery of data from cartridges, especially the dreaded Changed or Bad medium error.

The one program offered five different utilities: Autoclone, Patch Files, Salvage Sections, List Directory, Transliterate.

!!!Autoclone

The Cartridge Doctor attempts to copy all files from one cartridge to another.  If it finds deleted files, they are offered for copying.  Any files with corrupted blocks are offered for patching. This even works if the directory is unavailable.  Using artificial intelligence, Cartridge Doctor uses a powerful rule based decision maker, to make this process as automatic as possible.


!!!Patch Files

This utility allows direct patching of the blocks of a file.  It had one slight quirk as it always displayed a block of 512 bytes; however, as the first 64 bytes of any file was a header (a copy of its directory entry), it didn't display them so the last 64 bytes displayed on the screen actually belonged at the start of the next physical block used by the file.

!!!Salvage Sections

This allowed sections of a file to be copied to another file.

!!!List Directory

A handy way to see what files exist on the cartridge.  Along with the names, their file numbers are also displayed.

!!!Transliterate

This does a simple copy whilst converting every occurrence of a given character to another given character.

NOTE: We have not been able to remove the copy protection on this program - a key cartridge is required

wikipage: CD-ROMs
wikitext: !!!CD-ROMs For Sinclair QL

Although there are not many of them around at the time of writing this page, it is certainly possible to get and create CD-ROMs of software for some QL compatible systems. Gerhard Plavec in Austria has released the QL PD-CDR, while Q-Celt Computing in Ireland have released several CD-ROMs, and Urs Koenig in Switzerland has released the QL/E Distribution CD. On this page, I hope to convey information to help those interested create their own QL CDs and give information on those QL CD-ROMs already available.

Only some QL compatible systems can read CD-ROMs. The original QL with a Qubide, for example, cannot read CD-ROMs as the author of the Qubide firmware ran out of room to hold code to enable CDs to be read. Qubide version 2 units did contain some routines to allow software authors to access CD-ROMs and a trial version of Discover software was released with this in mind at one stage. Emulators can access suitably formatted CD-Rs though subject to the capability of the host computer. This is changing, however, with Thierry Godefroy's ATAPICD Thing and associated programs from Wolfgang Lenerz (QXLWIN) and Duncan Neithercutt (QCDEZE) you can now access CD-ROMs for QLs on more platforms than you used to be able to - Qubide and Q40/Q60 users can all now have greater access to CDs with this software. Another useful little utility to assist with your QXL.WINs is Qwirc from Per Witte. All four programs are available from my software download site.

You need to take account of how the host computer reads files from hard disks and CD-ROMs. If your emulator reads its hard disk files from a QXL.WIN file (e.g. QXL, QPC1, QPC2 use this exclusively, while recent versions of uQLx and QemuLator have the capability to read from QXL.WIN files as well as native file access). Determine whether a QXL.WIN file is required to hold the QDOS/SMSQ files, or if you need to create a 'dual' type CD with files held inside a QXL.WIN file on the CD and copies outside the QXL.WIN file for native file access purposes, i.e. so that systems which cannot read QXL.WIN files stand a chance of being able to read the files. This is the best option perhaps, but be aware of some potential difficulties:

The normal CD capacity of approximately 650MB may be effectively halved by doing this, since you need two copies of all files, so your QXL.WIN file can probably only be about 300MB (in fact, most QL software is quite compact so this may not be too much of a limitation) .

Leave space also for any manual or instructions required for users of the host computer (e.g. a DOS text file or a .doc file for PC users) 

In many cases executable QL programs (those you start with EXEC) cannot be run directly from the CD as the system will not be able to find the job type and dataspace information from the file headers of these programs on non-QDOS/SMS files. There are ways around this - use Albin Hessler's freeware MJ make-job or modify-job extensions included on the QL Today cover disk Volume 4 Issue 4 for example, or use the QL ZIP program from Jonathan Hudson's Web site (see QL links page) to store the executable file in a way that the header is preserved for QDOS/SMSQ when the program is unzipped. Either way, the program will not directly execute from the CD, you will have to decode it first and save it to your emulator's filing system before you can execute it. 
Some SMSQ systems such as the QXL only allow for one QXL.WIN file per drive, so you should not try to put multiple QXL.WIN files on one CD in different directories unless you are only aiming to reach QPC users for example, or if the intention is for the required QXL.WIN to be copied to the user's hard drive before use - e.g. a multilingual CD where the user could choose to copy a German, French, Dutch or English QXL.WIN file from the CD for their use. A workaround is possible to some extent using the SUBST command from DOS which is a SUBSTitution command, which allows assocation of a DOS path with a drive name letter, but seems not to work on some systems for CD-ROMs, only for hard drives. For example, the QXL sees drive J: as WIN8_ so you could try to put a second QXL.WIN in a separate directory on your hard drive (I have used the SMSQ drive names as DOS directory names to do this in the past just for convenience).

SUBST J: C:\WIN8\QXL.WIN

so that when you do DIR WIN8_ on the QXL, it looks for WIN8_ (DOS drive J: ) as the QXL.WIN in directory WIN8 on drive C: - this is similar in some ways to use of the DEV_USE command on QL systems. It is easy to tie yourself up in knots with this and best avoided if possible. Incidentally, SUBST J: /D will delete that redefinition of drive J: and if you want more information on SUBST type in HELP SUBST in DOS or SUBST /? in the DOS box in Windows. Also, be careful in case the QXL.WIN file copied from CD is labelled as Read Only by DOS/Windows in which case QXL/QPC etc will not be able to save files to it until the write protect flag is cleared from DOS/Windows.

You will need to give some thought as to what filing system format you use to actually create the CD in the first place. There are a relatively small number of QLers who use each type of compatible system, but overall the total numbers of all systems combined make it worthwhile giving thought to using a "lowest common denominator" format that your CD creation software and the target systems can all use. If your CD is aimed at one specific group you may be able to use a specific format which gives advantages such as long file names or deep nesting of directories. When I created my first QL CD-ROM I realised I'd have to use the ISO-9660 format which is rather limiting in that it limits lengths of filenames to DOS-style 8.3 (8 character name, 3 character extension) format 
some care is needed over how many levels of directories are nested.

There is such a format as ISO-9660 level 2 (not too sure of the exact differences) which relaxes some of these restrictions. But of course it relies on the target system understanding level 2, so for our purposes rather defeats the object of a 'lowest common denominator'.

I found ISO-9660 level 1 rather restrictive in some ways, but at least it did give me a way of producing CDs for QL systems which could hopefully work on everything which can read ISO-9660 from Amigas to PCs and Macs to Linux systems. If you create CDs using the Joliet extended filing system (e.g. to allow longer filenames), be aware that as I have found to my cost, Amigas and Apple Macs may not be able to read them. For Amigas, the Rockridge system is probably best - better still if your software can make CDs with both Joliet and Rockridge filing systems. Linux users should be able to access both Joliet and Rockridge.

To produce CDs in Rockridge format, I have to resort to using an alpha version for Windows of a Linux utility called "cdrecord" - it works, but it takes a long time to produce a CDs due to the number of hoops you have to jump through. I have found it rather frustrating trying to get hold of affordable software which can do ISO-9660 with both Joliet and Rockridge format extensions.

Q40 users - the Q40 can theoretically have a CD-ROM drive hooked up, but as I don't have a Q40 I don't know if these 'QL CDs' can be used on that system. If anyone knows, please can you email me with the details so I can include the information here. I think it may need some form of software such as QCDEZE for example to make QXL.WIN access easier.

The game was written entirely in 68000 machine code by Richard Land, who had a lot of experience writing chess program for the Z80 and other systems. Psion chess for the Sinclair QL was, however, his first 68000 implementation. The 3D board and interface was written by Psion.

A version was also available for DOS based systems and Atari computers.

!!Black Knight Chess

Written by Canadian author Francois Lanciault and marketed by Jochen Merz Software and [RWAP Software]. This is a pointer driven chess program, which also plays a reasonably strong game.

The program was written mainly in 'C' with a few 68000 assembly language used in critical routines.
 
A version 2 featuring a 3D display was also written but was never released to the public.

!!GNU Chess

Ported by Jerome Grimbert, this is a QL version of the free GNU Chess software. It requires at least 1.7MB of RAM, pointer environment and Toolkit 2 to run. It may be downloaded from [Dilwyn Jones Website|http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/games/index.html]


!!Wedgie

A freeware chess program by R. D. Lorenz, June 1984. This is a chess playing game written in SuperBASIC. It will not claim to be the best chess program ever, but might still provide a surprise or two!

The original program was written in SuperBASIC and later compiled with Q-Liberator. Moves are entered using a simple 5-digit co-ordinate pair such as c5-c6. Wedgie chess may be downloaded from [Dilwyn Jones Website|http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/games/index.html]

wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/choice_package.jpg|Eidersoft CHOice Package|align="i"|Sinclair QL CHOice by Eidersoft))%%%

CHOice is a program for use with the [ICE ROM] environment, which allows you to control up to 4 multitasking programs, which can then be switched to quickly and conveniently from within the ICE environment.

Oddly, although it was bundled with the [ICE ROM], CHOice was also sold separately by Eidersoft, even though it the manual states it does not work without the ROM.

CHOice also includes a RAM disk which you can also use for temporary storage of files in memory (although it needs the ICE ROM to be present).

When CHOice starts up, you are invited to install the RAM disk, or install tasks.  You can then select up to four programs stored on the flp1_ or mdv1_, by entering their filename, the amount of memory to be allocated to them, and whether the screen should be preserved when switching to that task.

You can also assign a different key to launch tasks and even save a task suite (all of the settings) for quick launch from within the ICE environment at a later stage (the suite details are stored on the microdrive cartridge with a name ending as _TSK).

CHOice also provides further utilities, including
- Desktop Decorator - a program to change the default colours used by the ICE desktop
- Mailmerge - a program to merge letters written in [Quill], with a database of address information created in [Archive].

We have preserved v2.00 of the software.

Citadel was published by [Eidersoft] and written by [Janko Mrsic-Flögel], although it was based on his earlier work [Metropolis].

In the game, you fly around a huge world split into many screens, with the idea that you re-unite the world by collecting together the sets of emblems representative of the East and West (teacups in the West, bottles of Vodka in the East!).  At the same time, you have to avoid the guns firing at you and the pirates who are also patrolling the streets.

Featuring excellent graphics, the game is controlled by cursor keys or cursor emulating joystick.   Controls are a little difficult to get used to as you have forward thruster and the ability to turn left or right  - to stop the vehicle, you have to turn through 180 degrees and use the forward thruster as a brake.  You can also use an air brake, but only once per screen!

wikipage: COWO Electronic
wikitext: Active: April 1984 – December 1991  (7 years 9 months). 

During his professional education in the automotive service sector [Urs Koenig] started COWO ELECTRONIC in 1984. Initial activities were CB radio and Sinclair home computers. Later on, the main objective shifted towards the Sinclair QL professional computer and its successors with the revolutionary operating system QDOS and derivates. Urs ran the COWO Electronic business (hard- & software development, publishing, trading) in parallel to his education, military services - where he served as an officer in telecommunication - and daytime jobs.

COWO Electronic's most prominent QL software product was [QTop] (fka [Thor-Desk]), the definitive user front end for all QL compatible computers. 

On the hardware side it was [ExeQtor], the limited edition SuperQL. This was the final product launch in the active period of COWO Electronic. So, it all started with hardware in 1984 and ended with hardware in 1991. Production of the ExeQtor ceased on 14.03.1993 when the last machine was shipped.

COWO supported not only the QL but also its derivatives, mainly the [CST Thor] series of computers where they acted as reseller of [CST] and later of [Thor International] for Switzerland.

After joining AGRO-DATA AG as software developer in January 1992, COWO Electronic's activities were fading out. Trading and software updates (mainly QTop) continued on a low profile until summer 1995. Urs kept the COWO logo and brand name for future usage.

In January 1998 Urs Koenig declared [QTop] and other COWO Electronic software packages as freeware. The software was then submitted as is to [Gerhard Plavec] for inclusion on the QL-PD/CD-R, the first of many QL related [CD-ROMs].

The [QL/E] software distribution, a bootable and ready to go virtual QL supplied on CD-R (somehow similar to Linux Live-CDs), can be seen as last QL product having roots in COWO Electronic. It was launched by Urs Koenig as a private person in January 2002. It was a kind of birthday present to the QLs 18th launch anniversary.

Nowadays Urs maintains QLing as a hobby with different activities such as his [QLvsJAGUAR websites|http://www.qlvsjaguar.homepage.bluewin.ch/] (information, pictures, movies) and the [Sinclair QL Preservation Project (SQPP)|http://www.qlvsjaguar.homepage.bluewin.ch/SinclairQL_preservation_project.html].

In April 2010 Urs founded a new legal company called [COWO Enterprises GmbH|http://www.cowo.ch]. This new company focuses on consulting and software engineering on the Microsoft platform.

The program was primarily designed to be used with the Quest Floppy Disk Drive, as it was reliant on the O/S card added onto that disk interface.  It could however, also be used from microdrive, provided you owned the [OScard] from Quest.

CP/M 68K Operating System was a full implementation of the CP/M operating system, with an added 68000 assembler, C compiler and comprehensive manual.

CP/M 68K also provided the means of controlling the [Quest Winchester Hard disk system].

wikipage: CP/Mulator
wikitext: CP/Mulator is a complete CP/M emulator which allows the Sinclair QL to run the wide range of software written for this operating system.

The supplied disk or microdrive cartridge included tools to convert CP/M format disks to QDOS format, so that they could be read from within the emulator.

The emulator supports all CP/M commands, including wildcards, and also supports the terminals expected by many of the CP/M programs in order to ensure that the screen is properly displayed.  The only programs which are said not to be supported are those written to use concurrent versions of CP/M.

The program is written in 68000 machine code, and uses an EPROM cartridge to emulate the Z-80 microprocessor.

This was based on an earlier CP/Mulator reviewed in the June 1987 edition of Sinclair QL World, re-written to allow it to multi-task with QDOS, and including an advanced file transfer facility to convert files for the QL, as well as being much faster.

Crazy Painter would at first glance appear to be a fairly simplistic arcade game - you have to use your paint brush to paint the whole of the QL screen.  Dip your paint brush into one of the tins at the bottom left corner of the screen and away you go.

Unfortunately, life is not that simple, as there are various things which get in the way - a big dog that leaves paw prints all over your new paintwork, a rival painter that will dump an old tin of paint on the screen, a spider, a snake and a bubble, all make it more difficult for you.  Some will take your paint off your brush, others just steal your brush!

Once you have finished painting the screen, you move up a level - there is also a challenge game after four levels, where you have to use your scraper to stop the paint dripping down past the bottom of the screen.

The [CST] Q+4 interface is a 4 slot expansion interface, designed to allow several peripheral cards to be plugged into a QL. It consisted of a small buffered card which plugged into the QL expansion slot, linked via a short ribbon cable to the large metal cased unit which sat underneath a QL, which in turn raised the QL to a comfortable typing angle akin to a QL with plastic feet attached.   Up to four interfaces can then be plugged into the four standard expansion sockets which appear at the rear of the unit.  The height of the QL is raised which may not be comfortable for some users.

It could be used with a memory expansion card and disk interface on most systems. Further cards (ones with on-board EPROMs) could only be used on QL systems able to recognise more than one expansion unit ROM (i.e. post-JM versions). 

The picture above shows the CST Q+4 interface in situ underneath the Sinclair QL computer, with three interface cards inserted in the rear slots, one of which is used to connect to the CST Winchester hard disk unit (sitting underneath the monitor).

The unit is powered by a second Sinclair QL PSU.

wikipage: CST Q-488
wikitext: The __CST Q-488__ provides comprehensive yet simple access to the IEEE 488 Instrument Bus for the Thor and QL. It was developed with IEEE specialists Procyon Research Ltd. The Q-488 interfaces directly to scientific equipment from SuperBASIC and other languages (e.g. Pascal, C, Forth and assembler) and provides commands for low level bus control and even built in bus analysis.

It can transmit data at up to 70 bytes per second and can handle up to 16 connected devices.  The Q-488 interface conforms with both GPIB and HPIB standards and includes a bus analyser as part of the firmware to help with debugging "awkward" devices.

Released in December 1984 by [CST], the interface cost £170 plus VAT.

It is extremely rare.

wikipage: CST Q-Disk Interface
wikitext: The [CST] disk interface was a standard two drive disk interface, conforming to the [QJump] FLP standard. It had on-board Toolkit 2 commands (how many commands depended on whether it was version 1, 2, or 3). It generally worked well and showed good compatibility with most memory expansion cards. 

The units only support Level 1 directory drivers only. Although no longer in production, second hand units do sometimes show up.  The disk interface was originally launched in March 1985.

We have seen two different CST Disk Interfaces as per pictures, marked as below :

| a. CST Q-Disc (copyright 1986)|((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/cstdiskinterface.jpg|CST Q-Disc interface 1986|align="l"|Picture of CST Q-Disc Interface 1986|240|120|POPUP))

Both are different designs and oddly enough we cannot get any of them to work correctly at the moment.  It does not help that the earliest interface expected the disk drive cable to be upside down, so you ended up shaving off the locating lug in order to be able to insert the cable.

Interestingly a letter from Colin Opie in the October 1985 issue of QL World states that it is possible by using a certain facility within the CST ROM to copy a while BBC disc or a IBM PC disk onto a QL disk (although no details are included).  He also states that he had developed a program for CST to be marketed by them, which would allow access to other disk formats, so that you could read their directory and then copy, print or view a specified file from within the QL.

It sounds intriguing - but so far as we know, this was never released and it is therefore (MISSING IN ACTION)

Please note that the Q-Disc Interface is easy to confuse the [CST Q-PI Printer Module] which looks very similar.

wikipage: CST Q-PI Printer Module
wikitext: The [CST] Q-PI interface was a parallel printer interface card which plugged into the QL's main expansion interface. As it was a dead-end device (no through port), it could only be used with interfaces such as memory cards which had a through port. 

Released in December 1984 at a price of £86.25 (£50 plus VAT), the Q-PI Interface performed well enough in its day as a parallel printer connection system, though these were quickly superceded by serial-parallel converter devices by other companies, as it was impossible to use a disk interface with the Q-&Pi; due to the lack of through port. 

Oddly, the parallel port uses an IDC-34 way connector, rather than a standard 25 pin DB connector. We have not come across the correct lead to use this interface.  The cable was an additional £11.50 on top of the price of the interface! 

No manual - simply use OPEN #3,par: PRINT #3, 'Hello World': CLOSE #3

It also adds the command DUMP_SCR to send a screen dump to a printer (presumably EPSON compatible).

wikitext: This RAM expander from Cambridge Systems Technology ([CST]) adds up to 512K RAM to the QL, using 256K DRAMs for full speed no wait-state operation. It also has a through connector to allow a disc interface to be added.

There are also four EPROM slots near the QL expansion slot, which allow EPROM software to be installed into the card (although the manual states that this only works with JS or MG ROMs - or later).

Interestingly, the through connector is above the RAM card, rather than being tacked on the end as is the case with most QL RAM cards, which allows the total width of the system to be a little less than might otherwise be the case.

The unit is housed in a rugged black metal case and the manual included details of how to get software to run which could not cope with the additional memory x=RESPR(524288).

!!Thor 1

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/hardware/cst_thor1.jpg|CST Thor 1|align="L"|CST Thor 1|240|269|POPUP))
The CST Thor was a recased QL circuit board, with 640K RAM and floppy disk interface and drive built in. It had a parallel printer and mouse port, battery-backed clock and a separate 84-key PC-AT style keyboard. It was built in a sturdy metal case with an expansion slot for peripherals. The Thor 1F had a single floppy drive built in, while the Thor FF had two floppy drives. The Thor WF had a 20MB SCSI hard and a single floppy drive. Thors had CST's own built in windowing system along with a version of the Psion Xchange software.
====
!!Thor 20

The Thor 20 was a development of the original Thor computer, using a 68020 32 bit processor. Was available with an optional MC68881 Floating Point Coprocessor (the version with this FPU was called Thor 21 by CST) and a choice of 12.5MHz or 16.7MHz clock speeds (compared to the Thor 1 and QL 7.5MHz). The 12.5MHz clock speed version gave a typically three times speed improvement over the Thor 1 on CPU-intensive operations, but as the 8 bit QL bus and slow memory was still used for everything that would not fit the 256 byte processor cache, the speed-up was negligible in practice on code that made substantial use of memory.
====

!!Thor XVI

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/hardware/cst_thor16.jpg|CST Thor XVI|align="L"|CST Thor XVI|240|269|POPUP)) 
While the Thor 1 was based on the original QL motherboard, the Thor XVI used a full 68000 processor running at 8MHz and had half a megabyte of memory, expandable to 6.5MB via 3 RAM expansion slots. The system used both the existing modes 4 and 8, as well as a new mode 12 which used the flash bit of mode 8 to generate an additional 8 colours on suitable monitors, or 16 levels of grey. I/O was handled by a 2MHz 68B02 chip. The Thor XVI had a video pixel rate of 10.67 MHz which allowed a 512 pixel per line display on a standard monitor without overscan. It also had a QL compatible expansion slot capable of handling most QL expansion cards apart from memory cards. SCSI interface optional. Enhanced QL-style network ports were included.

The Thor XVI had 128K of ROM and used an operating system called Argos, a QDOS derivative substantially rewritten and extended for the Thor computers. Xchange was included in an onboard ROM. The various versions and options of the Thor XVI were priced at from £690 to £2415!

Sadly, only a few hundred of these promising machines were made before CST's undignified departure from the QL scene.

wikitext: A range of hard disc drives for the QL by Cambridge Systems Technology ([CST]). They were available in 10, 20 or 40MB units, available with an optional 3.5" disk drive fitted into their cases. Apart from the 10MB unit (without floppy disk drive), the case had a set of power outlets at the back for use by monitors etc and incorporated its own QL power supply. 

The unit has its own interface card which requires a free QL expansion slot, so was best used with a [CST Q+4 Interface] or other backplane device if you needed to use a memory or other expansion card. 

At the time, these hard disc units cost from £1100+VAT for the base unit, up to £3000+VAT for the 40MB unit with twin floppy disk drives!

According to the news section of QL World (December 1985), a sophisticated data management utility was also included to allow simple back-up of data on to either floppy disk or microdrive cartridge.

Interestingly, QLUB News from September/October 1985 talks about them expecting to release an OS-9/68000 environment for the machine (as well as the disk interface) - known as the 'Cumana Upgrade'

The OS-9 environment was to include:
*A double density floppy disk controller for up to four drives
*A Winchester hard disk interface
*A RAM expansion unit (up to 512K)
*A ROM expansion unit (up to 144K)
*Both parallel and serial printer ports
*A mouse interface
*A battery-backed calendar
*A graphics kernel

Cuamana did bring out a version of this hardware on a board to act as a co-processor for the BBC (although it is unclear if this ever went into production).

I wonder what happened to the QL version?

*Facilities and performance superior to any other system
*Signal buffering between QL + Controller assures complete data integrity
*ROM based utilities
*Supports up to 4 drives in double density mode
*Uses 40 or 80 track drives, single or double sides, 3", 3.5" or 5.25" format
*High compatibility with microdrives
*Easily connects into QL expansion socket

The company also offered single or dual external 3.5" disk drives with the interface (the dual units sat side by side in contrast to the normal method of stacking them on top of each other).

Cuthbert in Space is a fast and colourful arcade game which is reminiscent of Jet Set Willy.

You are flying a large spaceship from world to world seeking treasure and resources.  Having landed, each planet has two phases - in the first, you need to fly a small shuttle about the screen to collect the 15 fuel cells required to get you to the next planet.  The fuel cells appear on various platforms and you have to manoeuver the shuttle to collect them and take them back to the main ship.  You can only carry one at a time, and your journey is made more hazardous by the flying alien spaceships trying to protect their planet's resources.  Luckily your laser cannon will destroy the aliens.

One you have collected all of the fuel cells, you can then go on to loot the planet - although the longer you stay, the more Moronian ships arrive to try and protect their valuable resources. You must collect as much of this as you can, again avoiding the alien spaceships, until you return to the safety of your large spaceship and fly to the next world.

The game is made more difficult by the fact that every so often, your mother ship will break down and you will need to use the shuttle to collect spare parts before bombs planted by the Moronians detonate. 

Two levels of play make the game addictive.

wikipage: D-Day
wikitext: D-Day is a table top wargame, set on 6th June 1944, at the time of the allied D-DAY invasion. D-Day was originally programmed by Dagenham Design Cell on behalf of Games Workshop (now more famous for their Dungeons and Dragons games), in SuperBASIC.  

D-Day has four scenarios - two based on the area around Caen, in Normandy, and two based in and around Arnhem. Here, you can control either the Allies or the Germans as they fight to gain control of the bridges and forge ahead towards Arnheim. 

You could elect to play the set scenarios of 50 units per side, or set up your own default units to start on each side.

At the request of [CGH Services] and with the consent of the copyright holders, [Rich Mellor] took on the challenge of correcting some of the SuperBASIC (to eradicate bugs and allow you to finish the game) as well as converting it to run from disk.  This was further enhanced by completely re-writing the SuperBASIC code to make it modular (instead of 1000s of lines of GO TOs and GO SUBs); implementing some of the features which were originally planned within the [SuperBASIC] and compiling it with the [Turbo] BASIC Compiler.  Hand written 68000 machine code routines were also created with some help from [Steve Sutton] to smooth (and speed up) the panning and scrolling of the huge screen.

After several years of updates between 1988 and 1990, D-Day MKII marked a real improvement over the original version, with the following additional features:

- much improved computer intelligence
- firing of units now takes into account the terrain a shell is being fired over and the ability to see your enemy
- the ability to 'hide' units from the enemy inside buildings or under tree cover
- a choice of playing with between 10 and 50 units each side
- the ability to play either the computer, or a second player - you can even play by post.
- the originally planned (but not coded) ships and lorries were implemented, meaning that you could transport troops, units and howitzers around the playing area.

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/darkside of the moon_package_back.jpg|Darkside of the Moon|align="I"|Reverse of Packaging for Sinclair QL Dark Side of the Moon Adventure))%%%
This is a text adventure where your mission is to recapture a moonbase and mineral mine -  you arrive in your spacecraft, and need to ensure that you are prepared for the trek across the moon's surface, before you reach the moonbase and deal with the problems there.

Contains over 150 locations - intelligent characters capable of carrying out tasks, split across 4 individual phases.  You need a password from each phase to progress to the next phase.

Also as an added bit of humour, when you fired your space gun, an arrow races across the screen, with an added sound effect.  

The characters are able to carry things on your behalf and also take independent actions and a lot of commands were created to fit certain situations.  For example if a scene said 'You can see a pile of rocks' then typing in 'CLIMB rocks' you got a result. Also if you found a hyperdermic syringe, you could type in 'INJECT syringe' etc.

The original version is limited by its need to have CAPS LOCK on (although mentioned in the manual, it is too easy to forget this)- the latest version, available from RWAP Software has been updated to remove these limitations.

wikipage: Dennis the Dwarf at the Funfear
wikitext: Dennis the Dwarf at the Funfear is a text-only adventure from the same stable as [Horrorday] and [The Prawn].  

Written by Martin Hopkins (Mert), this adventure is one of a series of two comical adventures starring Dennis the Dwarf. Again, you are getting up to mischief with your best pal, 'Enry the Elf, who, after you are thrown out of the local pub, decides it would be a good idea to explore a closed amusement park.

Poor ‘Enry sees nothing suspicious in the fact that the amusement park springs into life, with all the lights and music blaring as soon as you enter, and thinks a great night of fun is to be had.

Unfortunately, the proprietor has a very different idea of fun and the inhabitants of the amusement park set Dennis a series of tasks whilst putting the two heroes into danger and the perils of the grisly Freak Show.

Although it was reviewed in both QL World and QL Adventurers Forum in 1986, it was never released by the original publishers, [Talent Computer Systems].  Having been re-discovered in 2016, it has now been formally released by [RWAP Software] who were also able to provide the original author with a working copy!

wikitext: Dilwyn Jones is Welsh and famed for his appearance on the Tweenies (allegedly, for all of about 5 seconds). He is a former broadcasting technician who nowadays works in retail administration.

Dilwyn has been a well respected part of the Sinclair fraternity for many years and although he wrote [programs for the Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum|http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekpub.cgi?regexp=^Dilwyn+Jones$&loadpics=1], he is best known for his support for the Sinclair QL, having written several programs for the QL as well as trading for many years under the name of [Dilwyn Jones Computing], and then helping edit the [QL Today magazine|http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/gen/qltoday/qltoday.html]. 

QL Programs written by Dilwyn include:
*[Programs Pack 1] - MISSING IN ACTION
*[Launchpad]
*[Screen Compression Utility]

Dilwyn also supports a couple of public domain sites listed on the [links] page and maintains the current [Sinclair QL Homepage|http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/].

wikipage: Dilwyn Jones Computing
wikitext: DJC was a small one man QL trading company selling a large range of software. It was started by [Dilwyn Jones].

From simple beginnings selling a few of his own programs, floppy disks and sundry computer supplies it grew to sell programs by other authors too. One of the most successful programs was the QL Genealogist range of programs by Chris Boutal, which was rather a surprise as it was almost turned away thinking it would be too specialist a program to sell to the fairly small QL market - what a mistake that would have turned out to be!

DJC ceased trading in the mid 1990s, although Dilwyn Jones continues to be involved with the QL scene, having spent just under 10 years editing QL Today magazine (before Geoff Wicks took over as editor) and still writing QL software and articles.

wikipage: DISA
wikitext: DISA is an 68000 interactive disassembler for the pointer environment written by Jochen Hassler.

It features an automatic mode which tries to detect TRAP calls, system variables and other OS dependent things, but it really shines when it comes to interactively modifying the results. One only needs to select the beginning of a structure like job header, QCONFIG configuration block or even whole PE window definitions and DISA does the rest. 

DISA supports CPUs up to 68030 and both QDOS and SMSQ/E symbols. There is also support for an operating system named PDOS, which is an image processing OS the author used at work and has no relation to QDOS at all.

The last official release was v3.04, although Marcel Kilgus updated this to v3.05, adapting the program to run on high colour systems.  DISA was made freeware in 2017.

wikitext: A SImon Goodwin project which featured in an article in QL World's DIY Toolkit series. This allowed a serial  mouse to be connected to a QL serial port, and software translated the mouse movements into QL keypresses. Apart from an adaptor lead needed for connecting a serial mouse to the QL serial ports, no interface card or other hardware was required - it was all done in software.

wikipage: DIY Toolkit
wikitext: The DIY Toolkit was a long-running series of Qdos programming tutorials, packed with SuperBASIC and Assembler source, first published in a Uk news-stand magazine and later distributed as Quill DOC files as well as the associated programs. It extends Qdos in many useful ways and documents lots of interesting system features. It is now freely available as cardware - you are requested to send the principal author [Simon Goodwin] a postcard if you find the toolkit useful.

This Wiki page is derived from text on the [author's page|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/QL/DIY_Toolkit.html]. DIY Toolkit is organised as two dozen volumes, each implementing a handful of associated extensions to SuperBASIC, most originally distributed on microdrive cartridge. Volume sizes vary from 40K to 140K, including source, examples and documentation, and the code for each set of extensions is typically a few hundred bytes long.

wikipage: Double Block
wikitext: Double Block is a clone of the classic Russian game, Tetris.

You have various shaped blocks falling down which you can rotate and move left or right to fill the playing grid.  Each full line that you manage to fill with blocks then disappears.  This ends up being a race against time, as the blocks fall more quickly and once the blocks reach the top of the grid your game is over.

This is a good implementation, with  a two player mode, and also a more difficult mode with even more oddly shaped blocks! The game was programmed using Metacomco "C" and the title screen was made using Concept 3D.

As with the [Care Electronics Printer Interface], this version had an adjustable baud rate (default was 9600 baud) which was a useful innovation, as (without [Minerva] and [SuperHERMES]), both of the QL's serial ports operate at the same baud rate, meaning that you could not easily use a printer at the same time as other serial equipment (such as a modem).

Unusually, the interface also supported 19200 baud for fast printers.

Drawing Off-ICE (also known as ICE 3D Designer) is an enhanced drawing program which contains various small program parts to create text and graphics in 2D and 3D, and then overlay them to create an image.

It requires the [ICE] pointer environment complete with Mouse.

The program includes the following tools to help produce the parts of a page, which are then overlaid on top of each other to create the page: 

- 3D Graphics program - able to draw 3D blocks, triangles and lenses, with a user defined viewpoint and in solid / wireframe graphics.
- 2D Graphics program - able to draw line, arc, circles/ellipses, rectangles and triangles
- 3D Arc program - able to draw arcs in simulated 3 Dimensions.
- Char-Block - a program to allow you to layout text within a user defined rectangle.  You can use this to enter user defined characters into the block also.
- A text editor - this allows you to enter text in a variety of fonts, including using shadowed fonts and 3 Dimensional fonts (supplied).
- A bitmap graphics program ([ArtICE])
- Printer output to Cannon / Taxan / Epson compatible printers.

The manual appears as a Quill DOC on the disk.

wikipage: Dreamlands
wikitext: This is a text adventure based in a fantasy world - dreamlands.

Written by Jean-Yves Rouffiac, this is a large text only adventure with lots of twists and turns.

The synopsis:%%%
>Work, as usual, had been dull and repetitive, devoid of any spark or glimmer of interest.  Exhausted by its monotony, you returned home and went straight to bed.

>If only you could do something that was really worthwhile, lead a totally different life.  Live in a totally different world maybe? ...  But no, that was stupid - who'd ever heard of such a thing.  Daydreaming is only for children who could afford to invent magical worlds in their minds.  You had a job.  You had responsibility. And God were you bored!

>Perhaps after all, it would be nice to simply live out your dreams in another world, a dreamland where timetables and schedules were forgotten and where you could do something truly useful for a change.

>With these pleasant thoughts you fall gently into a deep sleep, only to be wakened almost immediately by the sound of wind.  Strange. Surely you'd shut the window?  And why was your bed so hard - as hard as stone in fact? What...

wikitext: !QL 2002 The DVD
Produced in 2002, this is the first QL related DVD ever released. It holds various video interviews and a QL show walkaround by Darren Branagh.

!QL Today DVD 2011
This DVD holds searchable PDFs of 15 years (1996-2011) of the QL Today magazine, plus as Bonus Material seven software, documentation and picture collections which were previously only available on CD-ROMs or on web picture galleries. Plus there’s a copy (mirror) of the biggest QL related website. All in all gigabytes of information for you to discover.
 
Even though the Sinclair QL is the main topic, both the QL Today magazine and the Bonus Material cover other Sinclair (ZX) and Retro Computing aspects as well. Articles by Rick Dickinson (Sinclair Research Ltd. Industrial Designer January 1980 - April 1987), Tony Tebby (Sinclair Research Ltd. System Software Designer 1982-1984, author of Qdos), Simon N Goodwin (remember his many articles in the 80s computer magazines and software like the ZIP-compiler for the ZX Spectrum) are just a few hot-spots to name here.
 
This DVD was only available together with a one year subscription of volume 16 (4 issues) of the QL Today magazine.

!QL Today 2013 The Final DVD
This DVD is the successor to the QL Today DVD 2011 and was sent out to subscribers in September 2013 with The Final Issue of the QL Today Magazine.

wikipage: E.A.S.E
wikitext: E.A.S.E is a desktop interface with pulldown windows and icons to allow you to perform various housekeeping tasks.

It was originally published by [Gigasoft] as __GigaDesk__ and then re-released as [E.A.S.E] by ABC Elektronic.

In common with many of the early [QL Front Ends], the look of E.A.S.E is based on [GEM|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_Environment_Manager].

The program includes a built in sliding square puzzle game and a calculator.

This was first released in November 1985, and sold as a package with the [Giga Soft Mouse].  [Giga-BASIC] was written by the same authors to allow you to create similar routines in your own programs.

Thanks to the two authors, and the QL Software preservation project, this program has now been released as freeware.

E.V.A was published by Westway Ltd from Lancashire. It is an arcade action game which is similar to Jet Pac for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum in some ways.  You control a suited spaceman, as he attempts to construct a pieces of hardware to repair the Space Station - blasting away at the aliens intent on destroying you.

There was a later version of the program which included a menu to select which screen you were to start the game at.

The advertising blurb detailed:%%%
"Life for a construction worker on a space station is hard ..... Even harder when the station is under attack!! Can YOU keep the twenty-six most vulnerable sections functioning as the alien attack increases in ferocity and cunning?

Then go E.V.A with WESTWAY......Purveyors of quality software."

The game was advertised in QL User 1985 with the following information:

"It really is great fun.....Easily the best game for the QL to date" - PCW 31/5/85

"Good flicker-free sprites" - Sinclair User July '85

Fully Joystick Compatible

wikipage: Easel
wikitext: Easel was the 'business graphics' package written by [Psion] and packaged with the Sinclair QL home computer.  The US version of the software was simply called 'Business Graphics'

Easel used the same friendly menu driven interface familiar to users of the other Psion business programs, [Quill], [Archive] and [Abacus] and you could import data between all four programs.

Easel takes data produced by Abacus (for example) and then allows you to display it on screen as a series of graphs, including bar charts, line graphs and pie charts.

Easel was developed originally on a VAX mainframe in 1983 in C by Martin Brown, and due to the lack of high resolution graphics capabilities on the VAX, a BBC Micro was actually used to act as a sort of monochrome graphics terminal for the VAX development software.

Tested on some of the in-house 'rack-based' development versions of the QL, the software had to be reduced in size using a 'table-language' developed by Psion, in order to ensure that the programs could fit within the QL's memory and microdrive cartridges.

In common with the other Psion business programs, the main problem with Easel was that it grabs all of the QL's available memory, thus making it difficult to multi-task with the other programs (even on expanded systems).  This was resolved by programs such as [CHOice] and [QL Switch].

Easel was also included as part of the [Xchange] package.

Work on the four Psion office packages [Quill], [Archive], [Abacus] and Easel started about 18 months prior to the QL's launch in January 1984.  Originally developed on a VAX minicomputer, discussions began between Psion and Sinclair Research about developing it for the QL.  The software was therefore developed in a way which allowed it to be ported to various machines and processors (eventually it was released for the Sinclair QL, the IBM PC, Graduate, ICL One Per Desk, Merline Tonto, Apricot and Sirius computers).

Coding actually commenced in April 1983, and because the VAX lacked any high-resolution graphics capabilities, early development of the graphics facilities in Easel was carried out on a BBC Microcomputer, acting as a type of graphics terminal for the VAX development software.  In late summer 1983, Psion were given a rack-based development QL to begin the work of testing - although Psion had to use their own 'table-language' to reduce the size of the code in order to get it to fit on a standard QL's 90K RAM.

It was this table-language which led to a lot of criticism over the original v1 Psion programs, which had to be loaded in parts from microdrive during use.

v2.00 of the software was released in March 1985, which was programmed in native 68000 machine code, providing a much needed speed boost and leaving more room in memory.

wikipage: Editing Help
wikitext: OK, this is not always as easy as it looks, so we shall try to a few pointers - please leave comments at the bottom of this page, if there is anything unclear, or you wish to add as access to this page is restricted.

First of all you have to register as a user and then login to the site before you can edit a page.

!!!HTML
You can include HTML in a page if this will help - such as <b>This is HTML</b>.  Obviously it is difficult to show HTML within a page,so we have used round brackets instead of less than or greater than signs to show HTML.  For example the bold text above is created with (b)This is HTML (/b).

====
!!!Line Feeds and Paragraphs
To create a paragraph, end it with two line feeds (press ENTER twice) so you get a blank line between each paragraph, or add a (/p) to the end of the paragraph (as in HTML).

If you want to force a line break, you need to add three % characters to the end of a line - a single line feed on its own is otherwise ignored - again you can use (br) as in HTML.

If you want to force a hard line across the page, use 4 or more "=" equal signs followed by a line feed, or (HR).

====
!!!Formatting Text
You can use __bold__ by using 2 underscores before and after the text you want in bold, or use (b)...(/b).

Similarly ''italics'' is achieved by using two single quote marks before and after the text, or use (i)...(/i)

If you want to include a definition such as ;wiki:an online resource which can be udated by registered users.

You do this by using a semicolon, followed by the term and then a colon followed by the definition. The definition must be followed by a line feed, giving:
 ;term:definition + line feed

If you want to create a list, you simply precede each line with either a * or - for a bulletted list.  If you want a numbered list, you will need to start each line with a # symbol.

For example:
( An unordered List )
- dog
- cat
- horse

(A Numbered List)
# Line One
# Line Two
# Line Three

====
!!! Adding Sections to your Text
In order to split your text into sections, you will need to create a title for each section.  Each section title will then appear at the top of the page, as a clickable link.

There are three depths of title - each is created by starting the line on which the section title appears with an exclamation mark !  The title line must end with a line feed.  

3 Exclamation marks is Level 1 (!!!), 2 exclamation marks is level 2 (!!), and 1 exclamation mark is level 3 !).

====
!!!Adding Links
!! Text Links
A text link is achieved through the use of square brackets.  If you enter one phrase between square brackets then it will be an __internal__ link within the QL Wiki.  Please note that this should be the title given to the page, complete with spaces (not the alternate title).

To make an __external__ link you need the format (Linkname|Link|Lang|Description) (''using square brackets'').  

Linkname is the text which forms the clickable link on the page.  Link is the actual web address you wish to go to (preceded by http://).

Lang is a two character code to represent the language of the page (EN for example) and Description is a longer description for the link which will be shown when the mouse hovers over the link.  Both of these are optional. 

For example, the following are all valid (except in square brackets of course):

| __Example__ | __Code on page__
|[Sinclair QL Home Computer Wiki] | (Sinclair QL Home Computer Wiki)
|[RWAP Software|http://www.rwapsoftware.co.uk] | (RWAP Software|http://www.rwapsoftware.co.uk)
|[RWAP Software|http://www.rwapsoftware.co.uk|en|All your Sinclair Computer Needs] | (RWAP Software|http://www.rwapsoftware.co.uk|en|All your Sinclair Computer Needs)

You can also use HTML code for external links such as (a href="http://www.rwapsoftware.co.uk") RWAP Software (/a).  This would appear on the page as <a href="http://www.rwapsoftware.co.uk"> RWAP Software </a>


!!Image Links
If you want to show an image, you will currently have to use an image which is hosted elsewhere on the web.

An image link is achieved through the use of double brackets - ie two ( ( (without the space).  The format is:

__( (source|alt|align|long description|width|height) )__

The minimum is just the link to the file - eg ( (http://rwapadventures.com/ql_wiki/themes/QL/images/qpc2.jpg) ) gives you ((http://rwapadventures.com/ql_wiki/themes/QL/images/qpc2.jpg)).

However, there are 5 more optional parameters:
alt - alternative text for text only browsers, or people who use a text reader.
align - this dictates whether the image appears to the left or right of surrounding text and can be 'l', 'L', 'g' or 'G' for left alignment 'r', 'R', 'd' or 'D' for right alignment.
long description - this is the http address of a separate file which can be used to provide more descriptive comment about the picture.

((http://rwapadventures.com/ql_wiki/themes/QL/images/qpc2.jpg|QPC II Sinclair QL Emulator for Windows logo|r|http://www.rwapsoftware.co.uk/DOC/qpc2.txt)) For example, you could therefore change the above to: ( (http://rwapadventures.com/ql_wiki/themes/QL/images/qpc2.jpg|QPC II Sinclair QL Emulator for Windows logo|r|http://www.rwapsoftware.co.uk/DOC/qpc2.txt) ) which would give you 

width - fixes the width of the image (in pixels)

height - fixes the height of the image (in pixels)

__Original Quick Edit Help - still to be transcribed:__%%%

wikitext: Over the years, various EPROM cartridges were released for the Sinclair QL.

However, [Sinclair Research Ltd] produced the first one - the Kludge, which was an elongated dongle which contained part of the operating system for the very first QLs.

Although the Kludge formed the original shape for the EPROM cartridge Board, the industry standard became one which was more T shaped, designed by [Care Electronics].

The main advantage of the Sinclair QL EPROM Cartridge Board, was that you could put two EPROMs into the back of the QL at the same time.

[EPROM Services] also advertised their own version of the QL EPROM Cartridge (for £14.95), which held two 2K, 4K or 8K EPROMs - presumably this was similar to the Sinclair Kludge version.  It is unknown whether you would be able to plug the more common 16K EPROM into this cartridge on its own.

[Camel Products] also advertised a Q-Cart EPROM reader (which was presumably one of these simple boards) for just £5.95

wikipage: EPROM Services Printer Adaptor
wikitext: The EPROM Services Printer Adaptor was a serial to parallel printer interface, which unusually had its own power supply rather than relying on the 5V from the QL's serial ports.

As with the [Care Electronics Printer Interface], this version had an adjustable baud rate (default was 9600 baud) which was a useful innovation, as (without [Minerva] and [SuperHERMES]), both of the QL's serial ports operate at the same baud rate, meaning that you could not easily use a printer at the same time as other serial equipment (such as a modem).

The unit was said to be in a 'fully enclosed black box' with all cables supplied, and had "adjustable parity / bits per character (for other computers)" as well as being double input buffered so as to ensure no data loss.

Exploring Artificial Intelligence on your Sinclair QL is a suite of well designed SuperBASIC programs which work to show how the Sinclair QL home computer (or any computer) can be shown to learn from its own program and therefore exhibit signs of artificial intelligence.

The programs include Doctor (a complete version of Eliza), Syllogy (a program which reasons) and even TICTAC, a noughts and crosses game which learns as it plays and improves its skill from game to game.

Highly readable, this also includes a discussion of learning and reasoning concepts, and a look at Expert systems, the fast growing offshoot of AI.

This program claimed to be able to copy a microdrive cartridge in under a minute (compared to the normal time of around 5 minutes).  It did this by by-passing the normal QDOS file handling routines and directly accessing the microdrive units.  It will also attempt to overcome errors by repeatedly trying to read a file.

The program opens its own window during runtime, covering #0 with a black-coloured background and green font. It does not use #0 for input/output and will not operate on copy protected files.

wikipage: FastNet
wikitext: In 1993 Qubbesoft announced the release of the Fastnet networking device for the QL and Atari computers, after taking roughly a year to get to the final prototype version. With hardware design by Terry Harman and software from Phil Borman, based on the original MidiNet software, the Fastnet consisted of a minimum of two interface boxes which plugged into the ROM ports of an Atari or a QL via a short ribbon cable connector. The box contained two 3.5mm sockets, two LEDs (one indicating transmit, the other receive) and an interface board inside. Fastnet could use QL network cables, and would happily work on a machine with "dead end" connections such as Trump Card since Fastnet worked by plugging into the ROM port, utilising the 16K address space available via that slot on a QL.

Software also had to be loaded, to provide the device driver and the fileserver - the device driver is responsible for transferring data between your machine and a File Server on a remote machine.
The device driver name defaults to 'N' but can be renamed to prevent clashes with the Toolkit 2 network station names.

Fastnet was claimed to be up to 8 times faster than the standard QL network on a standard QL system, allowing about 20K/second transfer, and even faster on a Gold Card QL or Atari ST running QDOS. In theory at least on the fastest systems the Fatsnet hardware was capable of up to 500kbits per second.

Qubbesoft cited an example of a copy of Xchange being started from ramdisk over the network in just 8-10 seconds versus 12-15 seconds to execute from a local floppy disk, or over 70 seconds over the traditional QL network. Fastnet also included a "read-ahead buffering" system which greatly improved the efficiency of reading small amounts of data, giving better performance to utilities such as QPAC2 files menu.

Fastnet was initially demonstrated at Quanta workshops in Autumn 1993. The cost of the minimum 2-station system was about £120 at the time, with additional FastNet station units costing about £65. It seems that not many were sold and by a couple of years later it was no longer being advertised

Financial Climes is a game based on the stock market - where you have a range of stocks and shares to purchase and sell to hopefully make a profit.

You can carry out company research before deciding which stocks to purchase or sell, and watch out for incoming news which may affect the prices.  The program highlights which are safer or riskier stocks and an overview of their trading record.

Each company has 10 products or services which can be released at various points during the game - affecting their risk profile, as well as their stock market value.

You can play against up to 5 other players (who may be the computer, or human players).

This program was originally released by Marshmallow Software on microdrive, in SuperBASIC.  An updated version compiled with [Turbo] is now available as shareware.

The game placed you in charge of a naval fleet in a playing area of 1000 x 1000 miles and you could move your fleet of 13 warships and 3 supply ships between two home ports and two neutral ports, whilst ensuring continued supplies of fuel and food for your home port - whilst seeking and engaging with the enemy, and coping with all that the weather could throw at you.

Di-Ren also produced a separate [FTCII Data Print Utility] to output previously saved Fleet Tactical Command data.

Flight Simulator was written by [Microdeal] for the Sinclair QL, using an aeronautical engineer to make it as realistic as possible for pilots and student pilots alike.

The program allows you to take off, fly around and land in 9 different worlds - you can select the weather, wind speed, direction and cloud ceiling to try flying in different conditions.

The view is from your cockpit and provides a 3D line graphics view of the mountains and world around you (you can also use a radar view)..  All major instruments are included - artificial horizon, altitude, compass, climb and revs, whilst you learn to master the flaps, rudder, landing gear, ailerons and trim.

The program was also released on the Dragon 32/64 and the TRS-80 CoCo computers as Worlds of Flight.

This game was said to be "Very fast moving.  Score points by eating, but avoid poisonous toadstools."

The idea of the game was to move around the screen as quickly as possible, eating the food.  The faster you ate, the more points you got.  The game ended when either you ate your third poisonous toadstool, or 60 seconds were up.

In the May 1985 edition of QL User, this was advertised as __'Merry Muncher'__ by Blain Software (before they changed their name to [Victory Software]).

wikipage: Founted89
wikitext: Founted89 is a program designed to allow you to edit and create screen display fonts for use with the [Text87] and [Text87 Plus4] word processor.

Due to the fact that [Text87] is built around the actual typefaces supported by a printer (to provide full WYSIWYG), it is imperative that the on-screen founts reflect those typefaces as accurately as possible.  Hence, the need for Founted89 - so that if your printer supports typefaces not already built into Text87, you can create your own on-screen fount for use in the program (and then Attach the on-screen fount to the desired typeface).

Due to the way in which [Fountext88] works (where the driving force is actually the on-screen font), Founted89 is essential for use with Fountext88, so that you can create brand new fonts up to 84x96 pixels per character (or even capture QL screen images (or part of the screen)) and then insert them in your [Text87] and [Text87 Plus4] documents for accurate printing to the printer.

wikitext: Fountext88 is a graphic printer driver for use with the [Text87] and [Text87 Plus4] word-processor.  Unlike other Text87 printer drivers, you do not need to [Attach] the correct screen font to a printer typeface, making this driver easier to use than some of the others.

Aimed at Epson compatible 9 pin and 24 pin dot-matrix printers, Fountext88 adds 30 high quality fonts (up to 72 pixels high and in different styles) for use with the printed output - they are all user defined fonts, rather than just using the ones built into the printer - thus ensuring that the printed output accurately reflects the fonts shown on screen. 

The program can be configured for two print densities and has a choice of single pass printing, or overlapping double pass printing. 

As a result, you can design your own special characters and incorporate pictures you have produced using QL graphics programs using the companion software [Founted89].

wikipage: From the Tower of Valagon
wikitext: A traditional text adventure with a large dollop of humour written by Alan Pemberton.

The synopsis:%%%

>Centuries ago, the Oracles foretold that the City of Hirin would become most prosperous, and that its ruler would lapse into self-satisfied complacency.  This indeed came to pass, and the King decided that he no longer needed the services of the court mystic, Valagon.  Spurned, Valagon retreated to his high tower on Mount Perehill to hatch an evil plot.  Invoking the evil spirits, he conjured up a vast army of orcs to take the city by force, and exact cruel revenge on his erstwhile employer.

>However, the wiser Oracles did also foresee the arrival of a handsome young Prince, from lands afar, to wrest the throne from the usurper Valagon, and restore peace and tranquility once more to the troubled land.

>But he got scare and ran away, which leaves you in a bit of a fix.  You find yourself in a forest clearing near your home village of Elak.  Can you fight against the odds and free the land from Valagon's clammy grasp?

Front Page was the very first DTP package for the QL. 

Running in just 128K on a standard machine it got around memory restrictions by storing different sections of the page on microdrive and swapping these according to which part the user was working on. This made operation slow and somewhat hazardous!

Front Page handled standard text and basic graphics and including a routine to print out on Epson compatibles. The program was written in SuperBasic and compiled with [Q-Liberator]. 

Enhanced versions followed for use with expanded memory culminating in 1988 with Front Page Extra 3. By this time there was competition from other software houses including DP and Sector Software and GAP no longer had the market to itself.

Futura Datasenter AS was founded 1987 in Ølen, Norway. The company started up selling personal computers and accessories. Futura Datasenter gradually turned more into a production company, producing hardware and software for various groups.

On the hardware side, developing computer cards for Atari machines was the most advanced production in terms of technology at this stage. On the software side, Omega had developed a software solution for connecting and drawing information from NTB (Norsk Telegrambyrå – the biggest Norwegian news agency). The solution was widely used both domestically and abroad.

Futura Datasenter continued its emphasis in the software development field and developed numerous database applications for businesses of all sizes. In this process, Futura Datasenter acquired a substantial competence and know-how in successfully applying database tools to solve corporate challenges.

In 1991, the ownership was re-organised and the name was changed to Omega. The company ist still active.

wikipage: Giga Soft Mouse
wikitext: The Giga Soft Mouse was one of the first mouse systems released for the Sinclair QL.  This connected with an interface which plugged into the QL's joystick port (CTL1) (and unfortunately for power supply in the QL's ROM port) and provided a mouse with a resolution of 0.26mm

It came complete with both [E.A.S.E] (a desktop front end) and [Giga-BASIC] a toolkit to allow you to create your own sprites and add pulldown menus to your own programs.

wikipage: Giga-BASIC
wikitext: This is a set of machine code tools and utilities for programming in Sinclair SuperBASIC published by [ABC Elektronic] and [Gigasoft].

The additional commands include sprite handling and real windowing handling commands, with the ability to add pulldown menus to your own programs.  The program also included a full screen editor for SuperBasic, which was able to check a typed line via the interpreter for correct syntax (like ED in SuperToolkit 2).

This was first released in November 1985, and sold as a package with the [Giga Soft Mouse].

Thanks to the two authors, and the QL Software preservation project, this program has now been released as freeware.

Quite a neat utility, this provides the most common commands you require and operates in mode 8.  Although the screenshot shows only a small area of the screen as the working area, you can scroll this about to edit a full screen.  You can save a block of the screen, or just the work area too.

This program supports either a keyboard (or joystick) as well as the [Giga Soft Mouse].

wikipage: Gigasoft
wikitext: Gigasoft was a German software house who wrote and published several software titles, including:

* [E.A.S.E] - A QL front end with a similar look to GEM
* [Fight in the Dark] - A fast space based arcade shoot 'em up game
* [Giga-BASIC] - A sprite and window / menu control toolkit
* [Giga-Chrome] - A screen editor with icon controlled commands
* [Pengi] - A good addictive game where you have to push blocks of ice to kill the enemies trying to eat you
* [QBall]

Gigasoft were one of the first mice (the [Giga Soft Mouse]) and an interface to allow you to use PC style [Keyboards] with the QL, as well as the [GigaSoft Mega-RAM] board.

wikipage: GigaSoft Mega-RAM
wikitext: The Mega-RAM expansion card from [ABC Elektronic] allowed more than standard 640K RAM to be used on a QL. This unit replaced the original 68008 CPU and handled up to 3MB of RAM via a new CPU (the 68008FN) which was compatible with the 68008 but allowed extra addressing space up to 4MB. 

A new command RAMEX enabled the new memory, after which the old 640K RAM could then be used as a ramdisc. With up to 2MB RAM, it was possible to use the old QL case, but the full 3 MB RAM version needed a new QL case. 

The board was designed by Ulrich (Uli) Rosowski. The software to initialize the board was written by Jochen Merz.

The board was supplied with a patched version of the JS-Rom to support RAM > 640k and a special version was released to work with the [Trump Card].

wikipage: Gold Card
wikitext: The Gold Card was the first of the [Miracle Systems] products to take the QL beyond the limits of the 68008 processor, the Gold Card has a 2MB memory and a 16MHz 68000 processor on board, which made it roughly 4 times the speed of a standard QL. 

Of the 2MB memory, 1920K of that is seen by the QL as contiguous RAM, while the remainder is used for display memory and shadowing the QL ROM and the Gold Card's own code.

The Gold Card also includes a 3 drive disk interface connector (4 drives if an external [Miracle Disk Expander]  is used). The disk interface supports DD (720K), HD (1.4MB) or ED disk drive (3.2MB) systems and uses the same drive connection slots as older disk interfaces such as the [Trump Card], allowing the same disk drives to be used.

[Miracle Systems] produced a twin ED disk drive set for use with Gold Card and [Super Gold Card].

The Gold Card features a battery backed clock, where the time and date are copied to the QL's inbuilt clock at startup, so the time and date are correct.

Gold Card has an inbuilt Toolkit 2 which may be enabled with a TK2_EXT command. It also has level 2 directory drivers for floppy discs and ramdiscs, so that you can use real directories as opposed to the 'soft' directories used by earlier interfaces.

The Gold Card attaches to the QL via the standard interface slot. It is small enough to live almost completely within the QL, with only the connectors and gold coloured heatsink protruding. Power consumption is low enough for the standard QL power supply to be used. Some people found that removing the 68008 from the QL improved reliability (the 68008 is redundant on a Gold Card system, so it may have had something to do with slightly reduced power consumption).

Although no longer made, this popular expansion card is often available as second hand hardware.

There were three versions of the Gold Card:-
* Version 1 - Yellow PCB
* Version 2/3 - Red PCB?

For some versions of the Gold Card and versions of the QL, there is a poke to uprate the clock from 16MHz to 24MMHz:-
* poke 114796,0

wikipage: Graphic Adventures
wikitext: Although during the 1980s text adventures were the main stay of anyone wanting to play adventure games (otherwise known as interactive fiction), the Sinclair QL saw some of the earliest graphic adventures, where control was through the joystick or cursor keys, rather than you having to enter commands via the keyboard, which then depended on the adventure being programmed to be able to understand simple phrases.

The following Graphic Adventure games were available for the Sinclair QL and can often be found second hand.  If you have an original program and would like to get a working copy on microdrive or disk, or to use with a QL emulator, [RWAP Software website|http://www.rwapsoftware.co.uk/updates.html|eng|Purchase Working Copies of old QL favourites] may be able to help.

It is also worth checking out the collection of adventures avaiable from the [Sinclair QL Homepage|http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/games/] as many former commercial titles have been released as freeware by the copyright owners.

wikipage: Graphic Construction Kit
wikitext: The __Graphic Contruction Kit__ (GCK) is a SuperBASIC command extension which adds a range of new commands to SuperBASIC.

GCK gives everyone the power to manipulate the Sinclair QL Graphics under SuperBasic. Written by Axel and Hans Georg Pabich in 1985, it is 100% programmed in machine code, which make the extensions extremly fast.

The first versions were exchanged privately at Computer Fairs until [Ultrasoft] stepped in and made it into a commercial product.

Martin Berndt (aka. Ultrasoft) also provided the translation of the manual and designed a better cover for the ''International Market''.

In the beginning GCK was just for private purposes because we missed anything other than simple SuperBASIC graphics commands. For example we wanted to add commands such as ''SCR_OUT'' and ''SCR_IN'' to save and restore screens in RAM. So we started with this commands which are capable to store 16 different screens in RAM. In a later version, we added the capability to store up to 32678 compressed screens in RAM, not because we needed it but because we where able to do it.

The Kit has also commands to directly exchange screens between Screen or RAM and Microdrives. It is also possible to manipulate the screen by mirroring or rolling parts of or even the complete screen. You can do a interactive or programmed Magnify of any rectangular part the screen and also fill parts of the screen with any ink or with a previously stored pattern.

The last Version (GCK 3.0) was made only by Axel Pabich after all the QL hype was gone, and the GCK wasn't sold any more. It is ''Freeware'' and in the meantime I am not longer able to work on it. So please stop sending money. :)

GCK 3.0 also includes some commands to interact with the [QIMI] Mouse Interface so you can use the ''QIMI'' mouse inside your SuperBASIC programs.

Graphic Toolkit is a range of various functions and procedures to help you to write programs which access the Sinclair QL's graphics.

As well as including some standard functions (such as QDOS$ and ALCHP), the toolkit includes commands for copy protecting microdrive cartridges, moving a pointer on screen, painting a section of the screen with a specific colour, copying part of the screen to / from memory and zoom (magnifying part of the screen by 16 times).

It has an unusual example program (Transfer_x) which allows you to load two screens into memory and then copy sections of one screen to another using a freehand brush (there are 8 brushes and two airbrushes included in the program).

A useful set of routines, unfortunately, it lacks any information about whether it can be used as part of a commercial program.

GraphiQL was a bitmap drawing program produced by [Talent Computer Systems] which was originally controlled by a set of keyboard commands, which could make it difficult to remember what you need to do next and therefore lead to mistakes.  

A later version, controlled by a popup icon menu was released under the [Sinclair Research Limited] label as [QL Paint] and later under Talent's own label as GraphiQL+

The cursor is shown on screen as a set of cross-wires, although you can also change the shape and colour of the cursor.

Quite a neat utility, this provides the most common commands you require and handles both 4 and 8 colour screen modes, allowing you to access the full 512x256 screen.  Files are output as full 32768 byte screen dumps.  This is one of the few drawing programs which allows you to set the flash attribute on each pixel, and includes the following features:

*Freehand drawing, 8 colours, optional flash
*Rubber banding, rubber boxes, circles and elipses
*Variable size texture definition
*Doodle pad
*Colour and texture fill of any shaped area
*User definable paint brush - any colour or width
*Colour list for full colour control

*Magnification with panning
*Mirroring and rotation of parts of the screen
*Air-brush effect
*On-line help facility
*Full file-store access

wikitext: Grey Wolf is based on a U-boat mission during World War II.  Originally written by Oliver Neef in Germany, this was released by [CGH Services], and then improved by [RWAP Software] to correct some of the English used.

You command the German submarine and your aim is to sink as much allied shipping as possible, whilst avoiding depth charges, destroyers and planes.

You have three views - the view from within the submarine, with sonar and instruments, the periscope view, where you can fire your torpedoes at sighted enemy shipping, and the map room.

You have to contend with attacks by planes and destroyers, as well as thinking about all of the other things when controlling a submarine - for example when you dive, are all of the ballast tanks full, hatches and torpedo doors closed, and the periscope down before you are too deep?? 

A training mode is provided to allow you to get used to the various controls.

All with excellent graphics and a real feel of the tense battles fought at sea.

wikipage: GST Computer Systems
wikitext: GST was a group of computer companies based in Cambridge, founded by Dr Jeff Fenton in June 1979 and were originally asked to produce an operating system for the Sinclair QL [68K/OS]. In the early days of the QL, this operating system was put head to head against an operating system developed in-house by [Tony Tebby], which eventually won the competition to be the QL's operating system (QDOS).

Originally GST Software Products was known as Electric Software and produced software for the Sinclair QL.

The software produced by GST for the Sinclair QL was:
*[68K/OS]
*[68K/ASM Assembler]
*[GST QC]
*[QL Assembler]
*[QL Macro Assembler]

In 2001 GST merged with eGames Europe as a new company, Greenstreet Software. It remains a developer and publisher of computer software for Windows operating systems. In July 2008 the company was reconstructed and now trades as [Greenstreet Online Limited.|http://greenstreet-online.com/]

In June 2010 Jeff Fenton, founder and owner of GST and legal successors, has declared all GST software written for the Sinclair QL as public domain. Details and downloads of an almost complete distribution can be found of this [webpage.|http://www.qlvsjaguar.homepage.bluewin.ch/QL_GST_SW_is_PD.html]

wikipage: GST QC
wikitext: GST QC was an implementation of C for the Sinclair QL, with some differences from the full Kernighan and Ritchie definition of C and based on Small-C (in fact the dialect supported is based on Rat-C). In the early days was referred to by the name __Small C__ although this name never appeared in GST's advertising.

QC adds comprehensive run-time libraries and allows assembler code insertions (ideal for optimisation of critical areas of the code), as well as listing control directives within the C source code.  However, it does not support Structures (struct, typedef etc), floating point, or multi-dimensional arrays.

QC came complete with
*C compiler to compile C source to 68000 assembler code
*68000 Assembler to translate 68000 assembler code to a relocatable binary
*QDOS run-time libraries providing access to QDOS functions from C
*Linker to link the library routines and the relocatable binary files
*Screen editor for the creation and editing of C source code
*Menu driven 'shell' to automate the compile/assemble/link process.
*Window manager to change the size and position of program windows
*Backup program for automatic microdrive or floppy disk backups

The output from the program includes a formatted printout of the generated assembler code with the C statements inserted as comments which was ideal for de-bugging.

As part of the package, QC included 'A Book on C' by R.E. Berry adn B.A.E. Meekings.  Unfortunately the source code to the libraries are not included.

Gwendoline is a platform game for the Sinclair QL produced by the Belgian software house, Labochrome.

In this game, you play the part of a knight sent to rescue Gwendoline who has been kidnapped and locked up in castle. The knight can move around, jump, use ladders (only to go up, but not descend) and attack with a sword. 

There are 38 screens in total to explore. You are battling against other knights, falling stones and other dangers, whilst the time is ticking away.  You can replenish your time by eating, but beware of drinking the ale which has the effect of making movement difficult: it reverses left and right while walking, but not while jumping.


The action is furious although its graphics are possibly a little too small..

wikipage: Hardware
wikitext: A wide range of hardware, including add-ons, upgrades and interfaces has been developed for the Sinclair QL over the years, so much so, that it soon became apparent that the single QL expansion port was not sufficient for the average QL user.

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/hardware/QL_expansion_prototyping_board.jpg|Sinclair QL Home Computer Prototyping Board|align="l"|A Sinclair QL Home Computer Prototyping Board|240|180|POPUP))
It is hard to imagine, looking back now that many of the QL peripherals and hardware have been developed over the years by keen hobbyists, eager to build their own hardware to make the most of the Sinclair QL.  Many of those expansions were developed on bread-board prototyping boards, such as the one pictured.

That said a wide range of hardware has been produced over the years, and much of it devising innovative methods to overcome the single expansion port. Some of the hardware was developed with through connectors leading to the "3 Foot long QL syndrome" where a chain of interfaces were plugged into the end of the QL.  Even more innovative hardware made use of other ports on the QL, including the microdrive expansion port, the serial and joystick ports (such as mouse interfaces), and hardware was even designed for sending two way data over the normally read-only QL ROM Port (including hard disk interfaces).  

Other upgrades fitted internally, making use of the various socketed chips inside the QL  - mainly the ROM sockets (which contained the operating system), the 8049 co-processor socket (used for control of sound, serial ports and the keyboard) and the 8302 socket (used for the microdrives and network ports).

Not content with utilising these various methods of connecting new hardware, the QL market also saw a range of backplanes created which provided tandem QL expansion port sockets, allowing from 2 to 5 interfaces to be connected in parallel.

The following is intended to be a full list of all the hardware produced for the Sinclair QL, with links to pages within this wiki.

wikipage: Heart of Gern
wikitext: The Heart of Gern was a text adventure published by [P.C.B.S.] where you play the role of a hero sent to recover the Heart of Gern.

The blurb contained in an advert in QL World May 1987 states:

"The "Heart of Gern" is the first of a challenging series of adventure games devised to test even the most battle scarred adventurer. Set in the magical fantasy world of "Princelands" you Tirac must continue the quest for the black jewel which imprisons the evil spirt-wolf, Gern. You must reach the Heart before the brotherhood, an evil cult of wolf worshippers whose aim is to release Gern. Hidden away in a secret vault protected by guards, traps and magical deceptions it will take more than luck to succeed, it will take skill, determination and bove all rational thinking.

Will this be the dawn of a new dark age or can the evil brotherhood by thwarted? The fate of "Princelands" is in your hands."

A ZX Spectrum version of this adventure was also released - although that is missing in action.

The follow-up was advertised as Fate of the Oracle - but appears to have never been released.

wikipage: Hermes
wikitext: Hermes from [TF Services] and developed by Laurence Reeves is a replacement for the 8049 coprocessor in the QL. 

The Second Processor (or IPC - Intelligent Peripheral Controller) handles sound, serial input and keyboard input. 

Hermes improves the function of the Second Processor by improving keyboard bounce problems, handles two key rollover, offers reliable serial input up to 19,200 bps. It has code to handle spare input/output lines (one of which is used by the old QView Caps Led kit). It allows different baud rates for both Ser1 and Ser2 input line, and separate from output. This can be used to drive a serial mouse (Ser2) and a printer (Ser1) at the same time. Keyboard keyclicks can be toggled off or on and there is a function to return the IPC version number. Sound was also improved.

Requires a small extensions file to be installed via RESPR for the extended features.

Note that 19,200bps input is nominal.  The maximum throughput at 19,200 setting is actually a little under 14,400 bps.  It simply means 19200 can be used without error.  A full 19200 output is possible.

wikitext: HiSoft are a small software company originally based near Bedford. They have since moved to the Isle of Wight.

They were known in ZX Spectrum & Sinclair QL circles for developing making Assemblers and other languages (HiSoft C et al). However they moved on to Atari ST and Amiga versions. 

On the QL, they released:
*[The SuperBASIC Extensions EPROM] - suite of toolkit extensions to SuperBASIC (the Super 'B' toolkit).
*[Devpac QL] - Devpac QL is two programs, one was the 68000 Assembler and editor, the other was a  machine code monitor and dissembler.
*[MonQL] - The machine code monitor, later included in [Devpac QL].

wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/hardware/sinclair_ql.jpg|Sinclair QL Home Computer|align="L"|A Sinclair QL Home Computer|240|180|POPUP))

The Sinclair QL home computer was originally conceived in 1981 under the code-name ZX83, as a portable computer for business users, with a built-in flat-screen CRT and internal modem. As development progressed, and ZX83 became ZX84, it eventually became clear that the portability features were over-ambitious and the specification was reduced to a conventional desktop configuration.

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/hardware/ql_production_line_issue6.jpg|A production line version of an Issue 6 Sinclair QL Motherboard|align="R"|A production line version of an Issue 6 Sinclair QL Motherboard|240|87|POPUP))
Other practicalities included the ability to easily assemble the Sinclair QL on factory production lines with the circuit board for the main QL motherboard and the two microdrive motherboards being assembled as one unit for soldering and chip insertion. However, even the latest versions of the motherboard still show signs of final modifications with wires and resistors added once all of the chips were in place.

Based on a Motorola 68008 processor clocked at 7.5 MHz, the QL included 128K of RAM (officially expandable to 640 KB) and could be connected to a monitor or TV for display. Two built-in Microdrive tape-loop cartridge drives (first seen as a peripheral for the ZX Spectrum) provided mass storage, in place of the more expensive floppy disk drives found on similar systems of the era. Interfaces included an expansion slot, ROM cartridge socket, dual RS-232 ports, proprietary QLAN local area network ports, dual joystick ports and an external Microdrive bus. Two video modes were available, 256x256 pixels with 8 RGB colours and per-pixel flashing, or 512x256 pixels with four colours (black, red, green and white). Both screen modes used a 32 KB framebuffer in main memory. The hardware was capable of switching between two different areas of memory for the framebuffer, thus allowing double buffering. However, this would have used 64 KB of the standard machine's 128 KB of RAM and there is no support for this feature in the QL's original firmware. The alternative and much improved operating system [Minerva] does provide full support for the second framebuffer.

There are also software and hardware solutions to provide a much improved display on the QL.

* A program SPLITMODE_ASM in the [Quanta software library|http://www.quanta.org.uk/?id=88] allows you to split a screen vertically in two, with one half displaying MODE 4 and the other half displaying MODE 8
* A program [Dithvide|http://omega.webnode.com/products/product-2/] allows two images to be interlaced, tricking your mind into thinking that there are more colours
* The [THOR XVI home computer|http://www.rwapadventures.com/ql_wiki/index.php?title=CST%20Thor&lang=en#toc_3] included a MODE 12 command, which provided 16 colours on screen at 256x256 pixels
* The [Aurora] Motherboard, which provided up to 768 x 576 pixel displays at 256 colours
* The [SMSQ/e Operating System|http://www.rwapadventures.com/ql_wiki/index.php?title=Operating%20Systems], which, when used on Q40, Q60, QPC2, the QXL or Q-emuLator, can display 16 bit colour support at very high resolution.

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/hardware/sinclairql_box.jpg|A Boxed Sinclair QL|align="R"|The Outside of a Sinclair QL Box|240|181|POPUP))Internally, the QL comprised the CPU, two ULAs, (ZX8301 and ZX8302) and an Intel 8049 microcontroller (known as the IPC, or "Intelligent Peripheral Controller"). The ZX8301 or "Master Chip" implemented the video display generator and also provided DRAM refresh. The ZX8302, or "Peripheral Chip", interfaced to the RS-232 ports (transmit only) Microdrives, QLAN ports, real-time clock and the 8049 (via a synchronous serial link). The 8049 (included at late stage in the QL's design, as substitute for a third ULA) acted as a keyboard/joystick controller, RS-232 receive buffer and audio generator.

A multitasking operating system, QDOS, primarily designed by Tony Tebby, was included on ROM, as was an advanced BASIC interpreter, named SuperBASIC designed by Jan Jones. The QL was also bundled with an office suite ([Quill] - word processor, [Abacus] - spreadsheet, [Archive] - database, and [Easel] - business graphics) written by [Psion]. Sinclair had commissioned [GST Computer Systems] to produce an operating system for the machine, but switched to QDOS, developed in-house, before launch. GST's OS, designed by Tim Ward, was later made available as [68K/OS], in the form of an add-on ROM card. The tools developed by GST for the QL would later be used on the Atari ST, where GST object format became standard.

Physically, the QL was the same black colour as the preceding ZX81 and ZX Spectrum models, but introduced a new angular styling theme and keyboard design which would later be seen in the ZX Spectrum+.  The QLAN network ports could even be used to connect up to 64 QLs and ZX Spectrum computers together in a mass network (although each ZX Spectrum needed a ZX Interface 1 to provide the network ports).

!!! History
The QL was the first mass-market personal computer based on the Motorola 68000-series processor family.  Pre-production motherboards show that Sinclair were still using the name ZX-83 as late as week 50 in 1983 (issue 2 motherboard).

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/hardware/sinclairql_inbox.jpg|The Sinclair QL inside a box|align="L"|The Inside of a Boxed Sinclair QL|240|213|POPUP))However, Sinclair decided to re-badge the computer as the Sinclair QL and rushed into production, to beat the Apple Macintosh by a month, and the Atari ST by a year. While clock speeds were comparable, the 8-bit databus and cycle stealing of the ZX8301 ULA limited the QL's performance. However, at the time of launch, on January 12, 1984, the QL was far from being ready for production, there being no complete working prototype in existence. Although Sinclair started taking orders immediately, promising delivery within 28 days, first customer deliveries only started, slowly, in April. This provoked much criticism of the company and the attention of the Advertising Standards Authority.

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/hardware/early_sinclair_ql_with_dongle.jpg|Early Sinclair QL Home Computer with Dongle|align="R"|An early Sinclair QL Home Computer with Kludge|240|127|POPUP))
Due to its rushed development, the QL was plagued by a number of problems from release, particularly hardware issues. In addition, early production QLs (issue 4 motherboard) were shipped with an external 16 KB ROM cartridge (infamously known as the "kludge" or "dongle") containing part of the firmware.  According to the designer of the QL's operating system (Tony Tebby), this was a marketing ploy by Sinclair, as it made it appear that the operating system was incomplete, rather than issues with the hardware. These issues were fixed in the issue 5 motherboard, and existing customers were advised to return their QL for upgrade (in actual fact the motherboard was swapped over to an issue 5 board). As a result, almost all of these early QLs complete with Kludge were returned to Sinclair for an upgrade and are now extremely rare to find in a working condition.

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/hardware/transparent_,microdrive.jpg|Sinclair Microdrive Cartridge|align="L"|The Inside of a Sinclair Microdrive Cartridge|240|180|POPUP))The QL also suffered from reliability problems of its Microdrives. These problems were later rectified, by Sinclair engineers, especially on Samsung produced models, as well as by aftermarket firms such as [Adman Services] and [TF Services] "to the point where several QL users report their Microdrives working perfectly even after almost 17 years of service (for Samsung QLs)" but in any case much too late to redeem the negative image they had already created.

Although the computer was hyped as being advanced for its time, and relatively cheap, it failed to sell well, and UK production was suspended in 1985, due to lack of demand. After Amstrad acquired Sinclair's computer products lines in April 1986, the QL was officially discontinued. Apart from its reliability issues, the target business market was becoming wedded to the IBM PC platform, whilst the majority of ZX Spectrum owners were uninterested in upgrading to a machine which had a minimal library of games. Sinclair's persistence with the non-standard Microdrive and uncomfortable keyboard did not endear it to the business market; coupled with the machine's resemblance to a ZX Spectrum, they led many to perceive the QL as something akin to a toy. Software publishers were also reluctant to support the QL due to the necessity of using Microdrive cartridges as a distribution medium.

Although in hindsight the new directions set by the Macintosh, Atari ST and others prevailed "most notably a GUI, which the QL lacked (until recently)" the core concepts of the QL's operating system appeal even today.

(vid)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxw-fV4gG3M(/vid)
On April 7th 1986 Alan Sugar and Sir Clive Sinclair announced that Sinclair Research sold its computer business and the Sinclair brand name for computers to Amstrad for merely £5 million.




!!! The ICL connection
__The BT Merlin Tonto / The ICL One Per Desk__
The QL's CPU, ZX8301 and ZX8302 ULAs and ZX Microdrives also formed the basis of International Computers Ltd's (ICL's) One Per Desk (OPD) - also marketed by British Telecom as the Merlin Tonto and by Telecom Australia as the Computerphone. 

The result of a three-year collaboration between Sinclair Research, ICL and British Telecom, the OPD had the intriguing addition of a telephone handset on one end of the keyboard, and rudimentary Computer-Telephony Integration (CTI) software. This curious machine interested a number of high-profile business customers, including certain divisions of the former UK Customs and Excise Department, but its success was generally limited.

That said, a former employee of ICL recalls that for quite a few years, ICL were operating with a fairly large network of One Per Desk machines, each equipped with disk drives and sharing data.  Unfortunately, all of the machines were thrown out in the mid to late 1990s to make way for Windows based PCs.

In the late eighties they were used in Bingo halls to allow a country wide networked bingo game.

More Details about the ICL One Per Desk appear on the [RWAP Software website|http://www.rwapsoftware.co.uk/oneperdesk.html]


!!! Another Long Lost QL Cousin
__Australian Associated Press Single Board Computer__
We understand that GST (who originally designed the 68K/OS operating system for the Sinclair QL) designed a single board computer for Australian Associated Press to act as a financial information terminal. Based on the QL's technology under licence, and incorporating the ZX8301 chip and 68008 processor of the original, these were rack mounted computers which could handle long cables to keyboards and screens at the dealing desks.  A couple of hundred boards were sold to Australian Associated Press, although it is unknown whether they were ever used!

!!! Post-1986 developments
After Amstrad abandoned the QL, several companies previously involved in the QL peripherals market stepped in to fill the void. These included [CST] and [DanSoft], creators of the Thor line of compatible systems; [Miracle Systems], creator of the [Gold Card] and [Super Gold Card] processor/memory upgrade cards and the QXL PC-based hardware emulator; and [Qubbesoft], with the [Aurora], the first replacement QL mainboard, featuring enhanced graphics modes.

The QL lives on in the form of two self-contained mainboards named [Q40] and [Q60] (collectively referred to as Qx0) created by [Peter Graf] and marketed by [D & D Systems]. The Q40 and Q60, being based around the 68040 and 68060 CPUs respectively, are much more powerful than the original QL and have the ability among other things (such as multimedia, high resolution graphics, Ethernet networking etc.) to run the Linux operating system.

Hardware add-ons are still being produced for the original QL mainly by [TF Services] who supply the [Romdisq], the [Minerva] replacement Operating System, [I?C] bus based peripherals, superHermes (keyboard interface, fast RS232 etc) and [MPlane] buffered backplane systems.


!!!Trivia
* Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux, owned a Sinclair QL in his youth, and used it to learn programming. He was inspired by both the shortcomings and virtues of the Sinclair QDOS operating system to create Linux. 
* The QL's Intel 8049 Intelligent Peripheral Controller actually ran at a higher clock speed than the 68008 CPU (11 versus 7.5 MHz). 
* When connected to a normally-adjusted TV or monitor, the QL's video output would overscan horizontally. This was reputed to have been due to the timing constants in the ZX8301 chip being optimised for the flat-screen CRT display originally intended for the QL. [Simon Goodwin] says actually that's nonsense - it's because the chip never ran at the planned 8 MHz on the available power and so the display timings (derived from the CPU clock) were pushed out of the standard range, leaving insufficient time for line flyback on TVs and most monitors.
* QLs built by Samsung for export markets had DB-9 sockets for the RS-232 and joystick ports, instead of the unusual and UK-specific BT630W (similar to BS 6312) sockets found on UK-built QLs. 
* External QL Microdrives appeared on QL accessory pricelists but were never produced.   You could use a ZX Microdrive unit (from the Spectrum), but the slot faced the back of the QL rather than the front as you would expect
* The QL was introduced at the time the SCART connector was becoming common in European televisions. The SCART connector carries RGB component video, enabling a brilliant display of the QL's four colours (black + 3) on a TV set.

[Simon Goodwin] reckons this is more rubbish; the QL's RGB-TTL output is way over the 0 dB levels for SCART, Sinclair never made a QL SCART lead, the 4 colour MODE 4 is incompatible with PAL colour TV bandwidth (even after dropping lots of pixels in flyback at the left edge), so the comparison would be better made with MODE 8, but the levels are still way off. Unless you (say) drop in some 330 ohm resistors... ;-) 

The QL video output was actually designed to suit RGB TTL monitors like the Microvitek and Phillips CM8833, which had been popular among users of the similarly colour-crippled Acorn BBC Micro, designed a couple of years earlier just up the road from Sinclair.

!!!Origins of Design
The QL's look was designed by Rick Dickinson, who also designed the cases for the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum.  His website also contains details of some of his sketches and ideas for the future development of the Sinclair QL, including the talked about Silicone Wafer expansion module with integral die cast heat sink and Polaroid back up battery. - see [Rick's pictures|http://www.flickr.com/photos/9574086@N02/sets/72157600854938578/]

wikitext: This game was published by [Snowsoft] in 1985 and is a variation of the Pacman theme

It was advertised in QL User (March 1985) as:

"Duck from swooping bats, avoid the ghosts, eat the garlic then kill Dracular before the coffin closes" (the typo is not mine!)

* Multilevel Pacman type arcade game
* Fast machine code graphics
* Large multicoloured sprites

We have now managed to preserve a copy of this game (which has meant we have had to fix some bugs to get it working).  You move Harry about the maze eating up all of the garlic, whilst 4 ghosts try to catch you - unlike Pacman however, the ghosts can glide over the walls, so you need to use more tactics to avoid them!  

We have only tried the first level and there are no power pills either, so it looks as though you can only run away from the ghosts.

Compware were also listing a program at the same time [Hungry Harry] - it is unknown whether these were both the same game.

Hyperdrive is a car racing game produced by [English Software] and was (so far as we know) their only title for the Sinclair QL.

In this game, you take the role of a Formula One driver.  The graphics are quite good, being presented in 3D with the view from slightly behind the car you are driving.

This differs from the other Formula 1 racing game for the Sinclair QL, [Vroom] in that you cannot go away from the sides of the track, making steering easier.  However, you do get oil hazards on the track which make you skid.  It is based over 5 stages where the object is to reach the finishing post at the end of stage 5.  On each stage you must qualify for the start of the next stage by achieving a top five position within the time limit.

There are 25 competing cars and if you finish the final stage, the game recommences, but the other cars try harder to swerve and block your path past.

This bears a marked resemblance to Pole Position on the BBC Micro and was also released as Elektraglide on the Atari XL/LE

wikitext: IBM PC Emulator was advertised by [Ant Computing] as a software emulator capable of emulating two PC based operating systems - QDOS and MS-DOS.

Version II of the emulator was advertised in the February 1989 edition of Sinclair QL World with a price of £49.95, with an optional module for £9.95 which allowed a QIMI mouse to be used as a PC serial bus mouse within the emulator.

There appear to have been quite a few complaints about the standard of this software, with the author (Guy Turvey) stating in April 1989 that he had not been as yet able to make available essential parts of the program.

__ICE__ (the Icon Controlled Environment) was an early attempt by [Eidersoft] to bring the QL's multi-tasking abilities under control, providing an Icon Controlled Environment and was designed to have a similar look to Digital Research's GEM operating system.

It consisted of an EPROM cartridge which contained the main software (and also came in a version with a mouse attached called Mice) and the [CHOice] tasking software on microdrive.

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/ice_system_cartridge.jpg|Eidersoft ICE Desktop System|align="L"|Eidersoft ICE System Cartridge))
((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/mice.jpg|Eidersoft Mouse System|align="i"|Eidersoft Mouse System (M-ICE) ))

When you switched on the Sinclair QL, you were presented with a desktop, which had some useful utilities built in (file manager, calculator, clock and calendar) and would also launch any programs found on microdrive cartridge, simply by moving the cursor with the cursor keys or mouse, and clicking on the icons.  The desktop was built up by displaying an icon list of files on a selected media. 

There were two types of media which defaulted to MDV and FLP, but were configurable for other devices.

Advertised features included:
*Uses next to no user RAM
*Always available to the user instantly - no need to load from microdrive or disk
*Fully compatible with the Psion applications and most QL commercial software
*Fully compatible with SuperBASIC programs and can be called from SuperBASIC
*Fully compatible with microdrives, disk drives and RAM disks
*Can be used in conjunction with the cursor keys, a joystick or a mouse
*Is multitasking
 
Some software was written for the ICE ROM including [ArtICE], [ChoICE], [Drawing OffICE], [ICEburg], [ICEicle], [Publishing OffICE]. An [ICE Toolkit] was provided to allow access to the mouse functions from SuperBASIC. 

However, it wasn't very popular and no other commercial software was written. 

So far as we have found, the last version of the ICE EPROM was v1.12, and the Mice EPROM was v2.1

The ICE Toolkit provides several new SuperBASIC keywords for writing programs which can read the mouse or mouse pointer from within the [ICE] pointer environment. 

The toolkit contains a full assembler listing of the toolkit itself, plus example routines in SuperBASIC and assembly language to demonstrate how to use the package from either of these languages.

It also includes a simple Icon editor program and also a program to alter the colours on the ICE desktop.  The ICON editor uses the button B to set / reset a square (it does not say this!)

We have stored v2.00 of the Toolkit which was updated to be able to work with the Mouse version of [ICE].

IMPACCT is the name we have given to a suite of accounting modules sold by [Xpert Software].

The four modules were
- Purchase Ledger%%%
- Nominal Ledger%%%
- Sales Ledger%%%
- Stock Control%%%

The software was advertised in 1985 as due before the end of August 1985 - with the Sales Ledger and Stock Control Programs available from mid July and the Purchase Ledger and Nominal Ledger to follow.

The finished suite of programs was then advertised on the back of the September 1985 QL World magazine at a cost of £49.95 per module, or £179.97 for all 4 modules.  At around the same time, Sinclair released their own [QL Integrated Accounts], developed by Sagesoft, at a cost of £89.95 which may have stopped Xpert Software in their tracks.

However, advertising then stopped and we have been unable to find a review of the software.  It was later advertised by [Eidersoft] from October 1985 as the Xpert IMPAACT QL integrated accounts system at a price of £49.95 per module, or £179.95 for all 4 modules.

The software is packaged quite differently for the Sinclair QL, with each module coming in its own grey microdrive wallet (with room for 2 microdrive cartridges) and the writing in red and green on the front cover (hard to read!).  Even worse, the microdrive cartridges themselves were standard black, with the name of the module printed straight onto the plastic in flourescent green!

The IMPACCT program which forms the main control for the system states that it is (c) XPERT Software and HTO Business Computers 1985 and on closer examination is a renamed ArchRTM (the runtime package for programs written as Psion [Archive] modules, using Psion's ArchDEV - see [ArchDEV/ArchRTM]).

We have now seen two versions of this a vB.01 which was sold under the Xpert Software brand and a version vC.01 which was sold under the joint Eidersoft / Xpert Software brand, with an extra cartridge XUTIL which loads the IMPACCT program and launches the various modules.

It is vC.01 which we have managed to preserve.

We have also now preserved a demonstration cartridge from Eidersoft, showing the facilities which Impacct offers.

The modules feature:

wikipage: internal 512K memory upgrade
wikitext: Various companies offered to upgrade your QL with an internal memory upgrade.

This was normally 512K, but some companies also offered a 256K version.

The method of upgrade was in two ways - 
* Removal of the existing QL memory chips and replacement to give a total of 512K
* An internal board, which connects to the 8301 ULA socket, and has a wire to the 68008 processor.

The downside of this method of upgrading the QL's memory was:%%%
a) The memory access was slower than external memory%%%
b) You could not use some of the later QL expansions, such as the [Trump Card] which themselves had memory built into the interface.

Internal interfaces were advertised by a range of companies, including [CST], [MicroPeripherals] and [Silicon Express]

Martin re-wrote the engine for Coursemaster and ported it to various other platforms: Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Acorn BBC and Electron, Amstrad PCW and the PC.  

They also produced several other programs for other machines, including:
* Poolsmaster (the former Pools Predictor software)
* Cashmaster book-keeping package and an invoicing sister package.
* Trackmaster (dog racing forecasting), 
* Perm Master (a means of developing betting perms)

It handles the following investment types:
*Unit Trusts (Accumulation, Income and Reinvestment)
*Investment Bonds (With or without withdrawals)
*Regular Investments into Unit linked savings schemes
*Ordinary Shares / Equities
*Gilts

The program acts as a simple card index file whereby each investment is entered onto one card - up to 75 cards can be held in each file, and you can add to your investments and sell all or part of a holding.

Income is monitored for each tax year, and by entering current stock market values, you can calculate the gain or loss, plus the percentage change and annual percentage change of each stock.

You can even set stop-loss limits for each investment, and those investments will be highlghted when you enter a price which has fallen 10% or more below its high value.

wikipage: Janko Mrsic-Flögel
wikitext: An excellent games programmer from Yugoslavia, who seemed to turn out a large number of games for the QL in rapid succession in the early days.  

Despite being only 16 at the time, Janko was the programmer behind the [QL Cavern] (the first platform game released for the Sinclair QL) and then produced more games for [Medic Datasystems Ltd] and [Eidersoft]

The games which he wrote were:

* [QL Cavern] (a platform game featuring the character BJ - collect the gems and avoid dying)
* [BJ Returns] (the follow up to [QL-Cavern])
* [BJ in 3D Land] (the follow up to [BJ Returns] - guiding the character BJ around a world in 3D)
* [Citadel] (very similar to [Metropolis] except you are collecting teacups and vodka bottles this time, whilst avoiding pirates)
* [Eagle] A scramble clone
* [M-Cosmic] (a very poor shoot em up adventure game)
* [M-Treasure] (a platform game, very similar to [QL Cavern])
* [M-Crunch] (a pacman clone)
* [Metropolis] (guide a spaceship through various caverns, collecting hamburgers and stars, whilst avoiding the police cars)
* [Zapper] (A space invaders type shoot em up)

Interestingly, in the September 1985 issue of QL User, he was said to be turning his attention to creating the equivalent of Ultimate's enormously popular Knightlore arcade adventure for the QL.  Wonder whatever happened to this...

Dr Janko Mrsic-Flögel re-surfaced in April 2016 with a new connection to Sinclair machines, by joining the management team at [Retro Computers Limited|http://retro-computers.co.uk/], the company behind the Sinclair Vega and planned Vega+ consoles (which can play ZX Spectrum games).

Unfortunately, they only published one software title for the Sinclair QL - a text adventure, [Dark Side of the Moon] which did not receive very good reviews, mainly linked to the reviewer omitting to use CAPS LOCK as instructed by the manual.

The game itself, is quite a good text adventure and sold around 150 copies worldwide.

David comments:
>Jaspar was a bit of a wizz kid writing Superbasic and I did all the designing, puzzles, scripts and testing the game for bugs. I couldn't write much software, but Jaspar was unable to play the  finished game, without my help.  We tried to be as professional as possible, paying a full page ad in QL magazine for a cost of about £900 for the first one.  We had a professional company design the artwork for us and all the microdrives and packaging was supplied by a factory in Telford, but we printed the instructions ourselves.  I feel we gave a reasonable story line in the instructions, plus a convincing story in the game itself, starting with the first scene in the spaceship, then the trek acroos the moon and finally all the problems involved inside the Moonbase.
 
>It took us about 2 years to complete, sometimes working until 5 in the morning and being saved on 4 microdrives, felt it was as good value as any other similar games, but maybe that was being subjective, based on what we liked about other games around a the time

>We developed our interest in the Text Adventures, after playing Zkul, written by Talent and while not exactly copying their ideas, we developed our game along similar lines.  We felt we included some enhancements to make the game more interesting, by having the characters able to say things and converse with the player-rather than just have lines like 'A Dwarf enters'. - I dare say most people wanted games with graphics-although we found the text adventures sold by talent quite addictive.

>Also as an added bit of humour, when you fired your space gun-an arrow raced across the screen, with a sound effect added.  Also, our characters were able to carry things on your behalf and also take independent actions and we had a lot more commands to fit certain situations.  For example if a scene said 'You can see a pile of rocks' then typing in 'CLIMB rocks you got a result. Also if you found a hyperdermic syringe, you could type in INJECT syringe etc.

wikipage: Joysticks
wikitext: The UK QL lacked standard 9 pin serial and joystick ports - instead it had ports which were very similar to a cut down BT telephone socket.  As a result, QLers had to either purchase a dedicated joystick or find a joystick adaptor.  The joystick ports were then mapped directly onto the keyboard, so a joystick in CTL1 would be the same as using the cursor keys, plus space as the fire button, whereas a joystick in CTL2 would be the same as using keys F1-F4 for direction and F5 for fire.

This meant that the QL could handle two player games from inception.

The US and German versions of the QL later made by Samsung both had standard 9 pin serial and joystick ports, meaning that any Atari standard joystick could then be used easily with the Sinclair QL.

As a result, a range of dedicated joysticks were produced for the UK QL:

| a. [Medic Datasystems Ltd] Joystick - this was all black and had a rounded base.((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/Medic_joystick.jpg|Medic Datasystems Joystick|align="l"|Picture of Medic Joystick|240|180|POPUP))

Karate was published by [Eidersoft] and written by Point Blank.  Point Blank went on to produce variations of this, some in conjunction with Eidersoft for other computers, such as the Commodore Amiga.

In the game, you face a set of ever stronger opponents in a Karate tournament, set in China.  As you proceed through levels, not only are the opponents more difficult to beat, but you start having other hazards which are thrown at you which you need to dodge or jump over.

Featuring excellent graphics, the game is controlled by cursor keys or cursor emulating joystick.

wikitext: !!!Replacement Keyboards

!![Schön] Keyboard

One of the few replacement keyboards that actually replaced the QL keyboard. The original lid of the QL case including the keyboard was removed, and this 64 key keyboard put in their place. The new case top included new LED indicators and the keys themselves were in a pleasant red and grey colour scheme. Replacement keyboards such as this one tended to need an improved IPC chip to reduce keybounce problems.

This product was also sold under the name Keyboard Products, and had some unwanted side effects - alas the connectors which plugged into the motherboard sockets tended to force the sockets slightly wider and as a result render the sockets unusable with a standard keyboard membrane without a spacer.

Also the ribbon cable ends came adrift strand by strand, and shorted - there was no hot-glue fixative.  The pcb contacts were evaporated 'gold' - ie not gold just coloured.  They oxidised causing missing keys. The only cure was taking it to bits - very very hard.

!![Schön] PC Keyboard

The interface card plugs into the 8049 co-processor socket and the QL keyboard and case cover is removed and replaced with a new cover which has a 5 pin DIN keyboard socket on it to allow an 86 key PC-style keyboard to be connected.

!!Rainbow Keyboard

A professional 'feel' keyboard with 81 full travel keys incorporating cursor and number pads. Described as 'simple to install' - it was a 'remote' keyboard, connected to the QL via a ribbon cable which required a slot to allow the cable to enter the case, and the ribbon cable was insterted into the sockets on the PCB for the existing keyboard ribbons.

!!ABC Elektronic Keyboard

Similar in appearance to an IBM PC-XT keyboard, this one connected via a 5-way DIN plug to an interface connected to the ROM-port of the QL. The [ABC Elektronic] interface is without any external housing so the unit often suffers from loose connection.

Knight Flight is an unusual platform game - you are a Knight on the back of a large bird and need to joust against other knights on screen - points for slaying dragons, knights, unseating knights and collecting eggs.

In the game, you take the part of a Knight, flying around a series of platforms on the back of a giant bird, with the aim of getting above your opponents so that you can unseat them - knocking your opponent off, results in their bird dropping an egg, which you must collect before it hatches into another knight.

As well as the various adversaries of differing talents, the ground is also not always certain, and you have to beware the swamp beneath.

Colourful and unusual, you have to remember to keep flapping your wings to control the bird.

Advertised features included:

- Addictive Arcade Action
- Continuous Music and Sound Effects
- Up to 21 Moving Full Colour Sprites

Lands of Havoc is a large graphical arcade adventure, where you have to explore a large maze made of 2000 screens, in order to collect items which will open up new levels.

The background tells of the perfect Land of Haven, cared for and tended to by the High Vanish, a magician as powerful as Merlin.  Then the Dark Lords arrived and, with treachery and deceit, overthrew the High Vanish and destroyed him.  The Land of Haven, then became the Land of Despair in which the Dark Lords worked their evil.

Vanish had prepared for such an event and the presence of his magic was still felt in the lands.  During that period of transition, the land became known as the Lands of Havoc and it was then that a stranger arrived...

Your task is to explore the Lands of Havoc, and collect various items (starting with the Book of Change) which can be used to defeat the Dark Lords.  As you collect each item, a cryptic message tells you where you need to travel to next on your quest.

Each level is cut into different areas (for example, the desert, the swamp, the forest, wild wood, village, castles, graveyard, the jungle and the mystics).

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/lands_of_havoc_packaging2.jpg|Lands of Havoc for Sinclair QL|align="r"|Packaging - cassette case for Sinclair QL Lands of Havoc|120|170|POPUP))
Whilst 9 maps of these initial areas are provided as part of the game to help you find your way, the way in which those areas link changes each time that you play the game.

The action is fast and furious as you move around the screen, avoiding (or shooting) various monsters intent on stopping you in your quest.  There are hidden ways of zapping instantly between locations, which can help.

This game was also released for the Commodore 64 and the Atari ST Home Computers.

wikipage: Lang Digitiser
wikitext: The Lang video Digitiser from CL Systems plugged into the QL EPROM slot and allowed connection of a single composite video source. It was capable of digitising a moving video source, taking just 0.02 second to digitise a picture at a resolution of 256x256 in 8 colours (mode 8), and capable of up to 5 frames per second. It could scan in full screen, quarter screen or 4 quarter screens. It could work on an unexpanded QL.

The supplied software allowed various software control of images and sampling. A later version of the Chin Lang digitiser was developed to work with the Gold Card (the original was not compatible with Gold Card).

A copy of the software is available on request to  [RWAP Software|http://www.rwapsoftware.co.uk|eng|Request Copy of Lang Digitiser Software]

It was a short machine code routine which allowed you to recall the last line which was entered at the input cursor, so that you could edit it and re-submit the line.

This was the fore-runner of the effect achieved with <ALT><ENTER> in both [SuperToolkit] and the Hotkey system (included as part of the Pointer Environment), whereas the SuperToolkit realized it with a polling task and the Hotkey system with a job.

As well as being available on microdrive cartridge, you could also purchase this for £4.95 as a Hex Dump Listing to type in.

wikitext: Launchpad is an easy to use pointer driven graphical front end for all QL systems with pointer environment and expanded memory. The original version 1 is still available - this would work on just about any QL system, whereas the newer version 2 demands a system with Window Manager 2 (either a fairly recent version of SMSQ/E or QDOS with pointer environment version 2).

Version 2 supports high colour screens (it will also work on 4-colour screens), colour themes and wallpapers. It has a small set of accessory programs (the usual screen savers, calculator, file handler calendar and so on). Programs can be assigned to desktop icons or to a menu drive launcher (vaguely like a Start button or similar menu based system). It supports up to 4 resizable desktops and includes file handlers, jobs menu, system settings menu and the facility to run programs not assigned to icons or menus, supports File Info II file associations (run non-executable  data files by executing their associated program) and even sbasic jobs.

wikipage: Lightning
wikitext: Lightning was a suite of routines which optimises the QL display handling, mathematics and graphics routines by replacing slow, general-purpose code in the QL ROM with new, fast routines, in much the same way as its pre-decessor and competitor [Speedscreen].

Programs did not need to be altered to make use of the new routines which automatically took over from the QL ROM's native routines for text, graphics and scrolling.

In common with Speedscreen, Lightning was originally provided on disk and microdrive cartridge, and then Lightning SE was released which included the graphics features on plug-in ROM cartridge.  Lightning Gold SE was then released which was optimised for use on the [Gold Card] and [Super Gold Card].

According to [Simon Goodwin], the inner character-output loop of Lightning differed in only a couple of instructions from that in [Speedscreen], and then only for a subset of csizes/colours and was clearly informed by a disassembly of my work.

wikitext: LocoScript Software was acquired in 1999 by SD Microsystems who formerly published business programs for the QL. 

Its word processing package, also called LocoScript, became famous as it was bundled with the Amstrad PCW 8256 (and later models) over one million of which were sold in the 1980s and 1990s. This machine comprised a monitor, disc drive, keyboard and printer and revolutionised the home and small business market with its all-in-one design for just £399+VAT; a fraction of the cost of an IBM compatible system at the time.

wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/lost_kingdom_zkul_package.jpg|Lost Kingdom of Zkul Adventure|align="I"|Packaging for Sinclair QL Lost Kingdom of Zkul Adventure))%%%
The Lost Kingdom of Zkul is a real-time text only adventure, which was written with a game generator designed by Alan Black. 

Originally published by [Talent Computer Systems] in 1984, this game proved very popular, with a maze which changed each time that you re-started the game.

The game is a classic adventure, in that you play the part of an adventurer, searching through caves in order to collect as much treasure as possible, balancing exploring against the need to keep your lamp replenished, eat and drink.

Originally published for the Atari ST and Sinclair QL computers, thanks to the [QL2K] emulator, [RWAP Adventures] have now released a version for Windows.

Synopsis:%%%
>The Lost Kingdom of ZKUL is a real-time adventure based in mythological times.

>Many centuries ago, the dwarves of the mountain, who had lived in peace for centuries, were besieged by the men of Caras, from far in the South.  The dwarves were all but beaten, driven back to their last refuge in the Domed City, when the great Wizard Taradon, summoning his final reserves of strength, led the dwarves in a last tragic assault.

>The men of Caras were defeated, but at a heavy cost to the dwarves.  Few survived that day, and those that did, remain there still, mourning their dead.

>Of the Wizard, little is known, although it is said that he remains in the Domed City, guarding the last precious secret of the old civilisation.

>Although the history of these days has now lapsed into legend, you have heard tell of adventurers seeking the Domed City and the great treasures said to be hidden in the dwarves' mountain dwelling.  Some have returned empty-handed, with tales only of failure.  Most have never been heard of again.

>Guided by your friend Eldomir, you have travelled to where he believes you will find the ancient dwelling place of the dwarves.

>As you approach the river, he bids you farewell, leaving instructions for you to bring any treasure you may find to the house in the forest.

wikitext: M-Cosmic was one of the free games published by [Medic Datasystems Ltd] - written by [Janko Mrsic-Flögel].

The game is a poor rendition of a graphic adventure, where you have to work your way through a series of rooms shooting all of the robot guards in order to get past to the next room - with the overall aim to save your friends who have been deep-frozen in an enemy space ship.  The main issue with the game is how it speeds up as you shoot robots, plus you cannot fire the gun if you are too close to a wall.

Featuring excellent graphics and background sound (which can be turned off) and the game is controlled by cursor keys or cursor emulating joystick.

wikipage: M-Paint
wikitext: M-Paint is a bitmap drawing program produced by [Medic Datasystems Ltd] which was controlled through a series of icons.  

M-Paint forms a full colour clone of MacPaint for the Apple Macintosh computer.

Quite a neat utility, this provides the most common commands you require. Only handles the standard QL 4 colour screen mode.  Colours can be stippled (using one of 126 stipples) and there is a recolour facility to change the colour mix of the entire screen in one.

Tools include the ability to draw circles, triangles, squares and pentagons, plus 6 standard brish sizes and unusual brush forms.

Alas it cannot handle 512 x 256 pixels and can only handle (384 x 182 pixels) meaning that screens are only 23296 bytes in length (compared to the normal 32768 bytes) - the program expects these screens to have an extension of _pic.

However, the screens can be loaded directly to the QL's screen memory although they only show as 216 lines of pixels, rather than the original 256 lines.  The 384 pixel display by the program is given stippled grey edges on either side.

The boot file shows another menu hidden behind the main program, which shows that Medic were working on a mouse to control the system at the time - presumably an icon controlled desktop, similar to [ICE].  This was probably an early version of [M-Desk], although it is a simple BASIC program to create the layout that is included with M-Paint.

According to the adverts, M-Paint was also supplied with the Medic Mouse for use with the [MEDIC Mouse Interface] which may explain the features within the boot file.

The program was later re-released in a compiled version, slightly updated, as [CADPAK] and included on a disk supplied with the Sandy [SuperQMouse] interface and also released as a separate utility by [Datalink Systems]

wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/books/0-09160-531-8.jpg|Machine Code Programming on the Sinclair QL|align="I"|Machine Code Programming on the Sinclair QL by Martin Gandoff))%%%
Machine Code Programming on the Sinclair QL is a more simplistic look at programming in 68000 assembly language on the Sinclair QL, with no real reference to the QDOS operating system, it concentrates on the opcodes and mnemonics recognised by Assemblers for the 68000 chip used in the Sinclair QL.

It is therefore a very useful guide for someone new to machine code programming or with a background using other processors who wishes to learn the basics of how to write machine code programs on the Sinclair QL.

The book forms part of the QL Series of books, which formed the mainstay of many a QL'ers library in the early days.

wikipage: Macro Assembler
wikitext: Macro Assembler is written by the same author as [Assembler Workbench] and published by [Talent Computer Systems].

Unlike Assembler workbench, this program consists of just the full screen editor and the Assembler program, plus a machine code linker also written by Eddy Yeung (in 1987).

Oddly there is not even a BOOT file protected, although the programs can be run with:

MODE 4: EXEC_W mdv1_EDITOR 

or 

MODE 4: EXEC_W mdv1_MACASM

Some example programs are also contained with the package, although we do not have a set of instructions.

We have preserved v1.1 of the program and wonder if this may have been the master sent to Talent before the program was released, mainly because of the lack of any copy protection and/or a boot program.

wikitext: Magnetic Scrolls was formed in 1983 by Anita Sinclair, Ken Gordon and Hugh Steers and were in their infancy when the Sinclair QL was launched in 1984, and entered an agreement with [Sinclair Research Ltd] to develop adventures for the QL.  The wrote a new operating system and fully featured parser which loaded into the QL and then loaded the adventure game.

Alas, it appears that the marketing of the program was troubled by the poor marketing for the Sinclair QL, and Magnetic Scrolls only published one program for the Sinclair QL ([QL Pawn]), although released titles for all of the retro computers in the 1980s.

Magnetic Scrolls unfortunately disappeared in 1992.

We would love to make QL Pawn available once again as it has gone down as one of the all-time favourite programs for the Sinclair QL, and most sought after program in the second hand market.

Matchpoint is a 3D Tennis game produced by [Psion] under licence from D and L Research.

You can play a second player or against the computer, or watch an exhibition match as the computer plays itself.  It is based on the Open singles tennis championship and goes through Quarter finals, semi-finals and the final.

The game was written entirely in 68000 machine code.

A version was also available for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and the Amstrad CPC.  The Sinclair QL version compares well, with multi-coloured sprites for the characters (the ZX Spectrum version were just black silhouette like figures) and faster game play.

Maurice Computers was a small company based in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, which produced a small range of QL speech and sound synthesisers in 1986/7. They also produced a a utility program called QL Stockmarket Investor.

!!QV200 and QV400

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/hardware/maurice_qv200.jpg|Maurice QV200 Interface|align="L"|Maurice Computers QV200 Speech Interface|240|218|POPUP))
The QV200 was a speech synthesiser card which plugged into the expansion slot. It was a single board design with amplifer and 5 Watt loudspeaker. Resident software on an onboard EPROM linked the unit into QDOS and supported mnemonics via which speech output was programmed. 

The use of an allophone based speech system gave an unlimited vocabulary which could sound quite realistic from a speech synthesiser of that period. The unit was programmed simply by sending allophone strings to the device, to generate the required speech sounds. The QV200 cost £59.95

A second version called the QV400 was available at reduced cost (£52.95), which differed in requiring an external amplifer.

!!QS400 and QMS400

QS400 is a stereo sound synthesiser. A single board design which plugged into the QL expansion slot. Full stereo sound synthesis, under QL control. Featured six tone generators, mixers, envelope shapers, noise generators, amplitude control and resident software in an onboard EPROM. It could be used for music synthesis or just for generating some quite complex and effective sounds such as bangs and explosions and zaps for games. Original cost was £69.95 for the QS400 (stereo version) and £59.95 for the QMS400 (mono version).

!!QSV400

A combined stereo sound and speech synthesiser on a single board which plugged into the QL expansion slot. Original cost was £84.95

wikipage: Media Manager
wikitext: Media Manager is a program to help you manage microdrive cartridges, including some semi-automated recovery tools, similar to [Cartridge Doctor].  

Originally written by Colin Opie, it was later upgraded to handle disks and non-QL formats (BBC / Acorn DFS, CP/M 40 track disks and MS-DOS disks), and re-named 'Super Media Manager'.  

Chas Dillon appears to have then re-written the program, and it was released in 1989 as 'Media Manager Special Edition' - although this version used a specific foreign file handling program (Xover by Stefan Schmidt) this handled Atari-TOS and MS-DOS disks and no longer supported BBC or CP/M format disks.

Chas Dillon has since made the SuperBASIC sources for the main program public domain.

Advertised features include:

* Selective directory, copying and erasing of files
* sector loading and viewing (cursor controlled)
* Sector editing - HEX and ASCII input allowed.  Automatically reports when mapping sectors.
* Sector copying to sector, file, device etc
* Viewing, printing or saving of drive map details
* Automatic (semi-automatic on disks) recovery of deleted files
* Bulk recovery of corrupt files to new files
* Header block or disk type information display
* Ultrafast string searching by sector or file
* Full directory sort facility - by name, size, type, date etc
* Control up to 256 microdrives or disks - directory of directories
* Direct file copying from other disk formats (PC-DOS, MS-DOS, CP/M,  Acorn DFS etc)
* Sector copying to other disk formats
* Text file translation utility - expands tabs, converts CR/LF to LF intelligently, converted files may be imported to [Quill]
* Disk sector editing for both QL and non-QL format disks, with all the usual features
* Full error reporting with automatic recovery
* Hexadecimal calculator

wikipage: Medic Datasystems Ltd
wikitext: Medic Datasystems Limited, originally of Basingstoke, Hampshire, were one of the earliest hardware manufacturers for the Sinclair QL, with advertising starting in early 1985, but alas also one of the first failures (hot on the heels of [OE Limited]).

They promised some good expansions, including memory expansions and disk interfaces which were designed to look like an extension to the QL.  However, due to problems with non-delivery, Trading Standards got involved and they ceased trading, leaving many early QL'ers out of pocket.  Indeed, the owner, Chris(?) Skoglund, ended up being jailed.

The range of promised hardware expansions included:
*[Medic Interface] - with disk interface and parallel port - 64K, 128K or 256K extra memory optional
*[MEDIC Modem]
*[MEDIC Winchester Hard Disk] (5MB in size).
*[MEDIC EPROM Card] - experimental card with 192K RAM allowing you to plug in several EPROMs.
*[MEDIC Mouse Interface] - also allowed connection of the Numeric keypad
*Professional QL Keyboard
*Add-on Numeric Keypad
*Joystick

As part of their way of saying sorry for the delays, they actually released some free software which could be obtained by writing to them.  These games were all written by [Janko Mrsic-Flögel] and consisted of the following:

*[M-Cosmic]
*[M-Crunch]
*[M-Treasure]
*[Metropolis]

They also produced a graphics package which suggests that Medic were looking to release a mouse controlled desktop system for the QL in 1985.

*[M-Paint] (A graphics bitmap drawing program)

Their adverts refer to other software provided free with every MEDIC disk drive system, which appears to use the same interface, although we have not seen any examples of these programs which are currently MIA:
*[M-Accounts] (Fully integrated sales, purchase, nominal ledgers and stock control)
*[M-Base] (Program to turn Archive into a menu driven database with single-key commands)
*[M-Boot] (Sets up RAM disks and then automatically loads pre-defined programs and files to the RAM disks)
*[M-Desk] (A Macintosh-type single key user interface for instant program switching and utilities selection)
*[M-Key] (Single key entry of user defined text in any program)
*[M-Merge] (Mail-merge program)
*[M-Spell] (Spelling checker with a 3,000 word basic vocabulary which could be extended by the user)
*[M-Squeeze] (File compression program)
*[M-Transfer] (Program to transfer microdrives to disk)

According to early reviews, disk systems were supplied with [M-Switch] pending the enhanced [M-Boot] and [M-Key] was also available (at least in a review version).

Some of their hardware did in fact make it to market but is now rare to find.

A few stories have come to our attention from one of the former programmers involved with Medic back in the day:
>The owner of Medic wanted to buy the rights to some QL games from a programmer. The programmer wanted a contract, so he got it,  on the brown paper bag some chips had just come from.

>The owner of Medic gave away the last development system we had at the time, to an angry customer who turned up at the door. Unfortunately I was using it at the time. My code was on floppies (which I rescued) but I had to wait for a couple of weeks for the next delivery of systems before I could continue on promised software.

wikitext: The Medic EPROM Card appeared in their April 1985 advert in QL User, although it had been dropped from Medic's advertising in the July issue, never to reappear.

The EPROM experimental card had 192K of memory and had sockets for you to plug in EPROMs for testing.  It connected to the QL via the [Medic Interface].

It is unknown if any units were ever released to the public.

wikipage: Medic Interface
wikitext: The Medic Interface (also known as the MEDIC Systemcartridge) was a rather large disk interface card (with support for up to four floppy disk drives) with optional memory expansion (up to 512K added RAM) and a parallel printer port, sold by [Medic Datasystems Ltd]. 

Further Medic interfaces and add-ons could be connected to the QL through the Medic Interface, including the:
*[MEDIC EPROM Card]
*[MEDIC Winchester Hard Disk]
*[MEDIC Modem]

A promising unit which was sadly short-lived. Some units did make it out to customers. Some were sent to customers without cases, although the case did improve appearance considerably, making it a rather neat (if rather large) all-in-one QL expansion system.

According to speed tests contained in June 1985 and August 1985 issues of QL User, the Medic Interface appeared to be quicker for file operations than the other disk interfaces tested at the time (Computamate, Micro Peripherals, Quest and Silicon Express), although this may have been influenced to some extent by the additional memory.

The Medic unit was supplied with free software including 
*[M-Desk] front end
*[M-Switch] task switcher
*[M-Transfer] microdrive to disk converter
*[M-Spell] spell checker
*[M-Key] function key definer
*[M-Merge] mailmerge
*[M-Squeeze] file compression
*[M-Base] database 
*[M-Paint] graphics program.

The software in the earliest of these interfaces were usually upgraded by users with a [QFLP] ROM upgrade from [QJump].

Prices for the basic Medic Interface (without disk interface) were:
*64K Medic Interface £99.95
*128K Medic Interface £129.95
*256K Medic Interface £169.95

The Medic Interface with Disk Interface was available for:
* Standard Disk Interface (no RAM) £129.95
* 64K Medic Disk Interface £179.95
* 128K Medic Disk Interface £209.95
* 256K Medic Disk Interface £239.95
* 512K Medic Disk Interface £329.95

The 512K Medic Interface does not appear to have been offered on its own - this was because the 512K version was powered off the Medic disk drive units.

Originally advertised at £120 (this was added to the price of the Medic Interface), the price dropped to £79.95 by April 1985 when it was first expected to ship.  However, with the ongoing delays in getting any equipment from Medic, the Modem price was back up at £120 by July 1985.

The advert in September 1985's QL User stated that the modem would not be shipped until BT approval was received) - so it is unknown if any modems ever made it into users' hands.

The Medic hard disk drive provided a 5MB formatted hard disk and was advertised at £299.95 including interface (although I believe it still needed the [Medic Interface] to connect to the QL).  This marked a significant saving on the [CST Winchesters].

Interestingly, this interface promised sub-directories, which could each be configured to emulate a series of floppy disk drives.

Again, this product was probably never shipped.

Their first major project in the micro field, was to work with Digital Research (who invented CP/M) to develop that company's Personal Basic (which was compatible with MBASIC).  Metacomco also bought the rights to the 68000 version of the TRIPOS operating system and continued to develop that, until it was eventually chosen by Commodore to form part of the operating system for the Commodore Amiga (AmigaDOS).

Metacomco also released a wide range of programming languages for the Sinclair QL and Atari ST.  The Metacomco Editor was chosen by [Sinclair Research Ltd] as the standard editor for its products, such as [QL Assembler]

Their range for the Sinclair QL was:

MetaComco's BCPL was the only version of BCPL for the Sinclair QL which produced true 68000 machine code.

BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language) is a procedural, imperative, and structured computer programming language designed by Martin Richards of the University of Cambridge in 1966 and was the forerunner of C.  BCPL lacks any data types and just provides one data structure (the Word).

Metacomco BCPL compiler allows a 32 bit word structure which can hold addresses, numbers, or characters.  Vectors can be set aside to act as arrays (these are areas which hold a number of words).  Metacomco BCPL supports the standard BCPL definition, but takes advantage of the QL's floating point and graphics routines (although if you want to do things such as change BAUD rate, or the screen mode, you will need to write an assembler routine to be linked in to do this).

Advertised features included:
*True compiler
*Multiple BCPL programs can run concurrently
*Full runtime library includes interfaces to QDOS graphics, file operations, window handling, etc.
*Exception handling provides diagnostics for debugging
*Link loader allows linkage of separately compiled segments
*Assembler, Pascal and BCPL modules can be linked together
*32-bit variables use the full QL address space

It was part of a modular set of languages, all written in BCPL which enabled the output to be linked with QL C, Pascal and/or Assembler modules (written using the MetaComco versions of course, not SROFF compatible) to create the final file.

Known programs, written with MetaComCo BCPL are [PCB Designer 1] and [PCB Designer 2] from [Talent Computer Systems] and [QATS] from [Cope].

MetaComco's Pascal was the first Pascal for the Sinclair QL which met the ISO 7185 level 0 standard and produced true 68000 machine code.

PASCAL (named after the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal) was designed in 1968/9 and published in 1970 by Niklaus Wirth as a small and efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring.  Each variable has to be associated with a type (such as CHAR, INTEGER or REAL), but copying between data types generally causes an error, limiting the language's flexibility.

Pascal's ability to enumerate types and form complex data structures makes it suitable for structured data processing and arithmetic, algorithmic problems.

Metacomco PASCAL generates fully executable 68000 machine code programs and also met the ISO standard for Pascal, unlike the [C1 Pascal] which needed an interpreter to be present.

Usefully, when compiling your program, you cam state whether range-checking can be omitted, which will speed execution time slightly if your program is able to work without this.  You can also include ISO standard extensions at the compilation stage to make use of the QL dependent features.  This allows you to link programs written using another compiler (say BCPL or Assembler), as well as allowing you to use the QTRAP routine to directly access QDOS TRAP commands.

Advertised features included:
*First software house to achieve full ISO validation of a Pascal compiler for the 68000
*True compiler producing native 68000 code: compact and efficient
*Fast, single pass compilation without intermediate stages
*Complete implementation of ISO 7185 - the international standard for Pascal - making it ideal for commercial and educational use
*Direct addressing of the full QL address space
*Key routines provided on ROM for extra speed and convenience
*No run time licences required for commercial applications written using QL Pascal
*Any length variable names and full 32-bit integers
*Easy to use interfaces to QL windows, graphics, traps, screen handling, file operations, etc.
*Will handle very large sets and arrays
*Approved by Sinclair Research for use on the QL

It was part of a modular set of languages, all written in BCPL which enabled the output to be linked with BCPL and/or Assembler modules (written using the MetaComco versions of course) to create the final file.

An EPROM was required in order to run the software.

wikitext: Metropolis was one of the free games published by [Medic Datasystems Ltd] - written by [Janko Mrsic-Flögel] and is very similar to [Citadel].

In the game, you fly around a huge world split into some 50 different screens, with the idea that you re-unite the world by collecting together the sets of emblems representative of the East and West (hamburgers in the West, red stars in the East!).  At the same time, you have to avoid the guns firing at you and the police cars who are also patrolling the streets.

Featuring excellent graphics, the game is controlled by cursor keys or cursor emulating joystick.   Controls are a little difficult to get used to as you have forward thruster and the ability to turn left or right  - to stop the vehicle, you have to turn through 180 degrees and use the forward thruster as a brake.  You can also use an air brake, but only once per screen!

With the demise of [Medic Datasystems Ltd] , the author updated this game and released it as [Citadel]

wikipage: Micro Peripherals Floppy Disk Interface
wikitext: A disk interface system  made by [Micro Peripherals Ltd] which was later badged by Sinclair as their "official" disc system. It used its own software (written by Richard Miller) and did not conform to the [QJump] "FLP" system used by most companies at the time (it used the name FDK to access the disk drives). The fact that the device name was not "FLP" put a lot of users off. 

The unit does not support direct sector access.  

A [QFLP] upgrade ROM from [QJump] was available which changed the device name to FLP and added direct sector access

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/hardware/sinclair_disk.jpg|Sinclair Disk System|align="i"|Sinclair's QL Disk System|240|140|POPUP))
((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/hardware/sinclair_disk_box.jpg|Sinclair Disk System|align="i"|Sinclair's QL Disk System|240|147|POPUP))%%%
The interface had an 8K onboard EPROM providing the device driver and toolkit extensions, which included:

* DGET - Load sector into an array
* DPUT - Save an array to a sector
* MSET, FSET - Toggle microdrive emulation mode
* VSET - Rename the disk device (the interface normally uses the drive name FDK rather than the FLP used by most other QL disk systems)

Plus several other extensions similar to those in other disk interfaces, and some utility programs such as a disk and memory editor were supplied on disk.

A copy of the utility disk is available from [RWAP Software].

The interface was supplied with either one, or a pair of DSDD 720KB drives, the first of which took its power from an external transformer via a 6-way power connector, and the second took its power from the DC output of the first drive via a 5-way connector, plus a ribbon connector from one drive to the other. 

The interface had switch-selectable options via a series of jumpers to format single or double sided, and 3ms or 6ms track to track time.  Another jumper could be set to make the QL boot from an 'mdv' named disk.

wikipage: Micro Process Controller
wikitext: The Micro Process Controller is a unit by [Di-Ren] with 6 switched relays, connected via a parallel interface (or serial to parallel converter) with a through port for a parallel printer. 

The switched relays allow you to control other electrical equipment, such a as lights, radio, or even time sensitive photographic control.  Controlled by the computer, this allows speed of switching to be set from micro-seconds to days.

Two units could be connected in series if no printer is used. Each relay could switch up to 240V AC at 3 amps and easily controlled from BASIC. 

The MPC unit was contained in a small black box and powered either by 9V battery or external 9V 250mA power supply.

Advertised features:
*Inexpensive
*Self-contained unit
*Connects to a computer's printers parallel interface

There is some confusion over what they published for the QL - since the Instant Access section refers to a program from them caled *[QL Terminator Emulator] (this may of course be a typo - maybe it was a Terminal Emulator).  In an early letter from Sinclair Research (undated) listing programs available for the Sinclair QL, which states that they published [QL Forth 83].

We have however, received confirmation that the company with this address are not the same company as MicroProcessor Engineering Ltd who wrote [C1 Forth] - it is therefore probable that this was a typo in QL User and that the Instant Access entry mixes this company's details with those for [Micrologic Consultants].

wikipage: Miracle Centronics Interface
wikitext: This popular printer interface from [Miracle Systems] plugged into SER1 or SER2 and converted printer output from those ports into a form suitable for a parallel printer. It was supplied with up to 3metres of cable. There were at least three versions of this interface, which must have been among the biggest selling QL hardware of all time:

1. The earliest versions were in a small white box with a dot matrix printed label on the top with a cable to the QL, and a second cable to the printer, and a plastic centronics connector. Worked from SER1 only.

2. The second version was a more professional looking unit in a black box with a Centronics printer connector mounted on the box itself. Could work from either SER1 or SER2

3. The later versions had a miniaturised circuit board which was small enough to fit in the hood of the printer connector, and could also work from SER1 or SER2.  The one sold by [Miracle Systems] had a metal housing, whereas one produced by them for sale by [TF Services] had a plastic hood.

wikipage: Miracle Hard Disk
wikitext: A hard disk unit which plugged into the QL ROM slot, with a through connector for a ROM cartridge. 

The hard disk itself had 40MB capacity and contained an ST506 5.25" winchester hard disk drive, complete with a controller card and a fan (although the fan was not present in all of the Miracle Systems hard disk units for some reason).  The controller card is connected to the hard disk with two cables - a data cable and a drive control cable (which tells the drive which track and sector the head needs to move to).

The complete package included the interface, a main power supply and a metal cased hard disk drive, which measured almost as long as the QL itself.

The disk drive head is parked after 5 seconds of inactivity in order to protect them.

The driver software used the familiar "WIN" device name and supported level 2 directories and was the first hardware to successfully implement a means of performing read and write operations via the QL's (nominally) read-only ROM port.  A file WIN_REXT included on the hard disk when supplied included various commands and improvements to the Toolkit II commands to control the hard disk, such as WIN_USE 'mdv' and changes to the DIR and STAT commands to show the number of 512 Byte sectors correctly (due to the large number of sectors, negative numbers may be displayed otherwise).

The driver software was written by Tony Tebby and is (beside the harddisk driver of Atari emulator, SMS2 and Qxx) the only native hardware driver for a harddisk from Tony Tebby, which means it does not use the QXL.WIN container mechanism instead accesses the hardware directly via the driver.

The commands also added FVERS and FBKDT functions to return the file version of a file and the last backup date of the file respectively, along with commands to set these values (SET_FVERS and SET_FBKDT)

Their advert in QL User, December 1985, also referred to QL Mouse (please call).  So far as we know, Miracle never released a mouse system for the QL.  By 1992, Miracle had expanded and announced the addition of Noud Sneider (a Dutch engineer) to their staff.  The same announcement talked about the forthcoming Graphics card, although this does not appear to have ever been released.

Stuart Honeyball also wrote the firmware for [TF Services]' [Romdisq]

To complement the hardware, Miracle Systems also produced external dual disk drive units which made the most of the 1/3rd height 3.5" floppy disk drives available - these disk drives were produced in both DD (720K) versions and ED (3.2MB) versions.

wikipage: MonQL
wikitext: MonQL is a machine code monitor and disassembler written by [Andrew Pennell].

You can switch between MonQL and SuperBasic by using CTRL+Q and from there to re-enter the program by typing MONQL as a procedure named.

The display is spit into two - yhe first contains information on the state of some 68008 registers. The values contained within the Program Counter and Status register are shown. The flags which have been set within the Status Register are also displayed. 

Other monitor functions include memory block copy, set Memory Pointer, register modify, base conversion, insert breakpoints, and a series of search facilities which can be done using byte, word, or long words. The function keys have also been set up to change the size and position of the front panel window.

MonQL was later released in a plug in ROM format, and also incorporated into [Devpac QL].

The ROM version incorporated new features, including on-line help menus and new SuperBASIC commands, such as JBREAK which allows a programmer to interrupt a multi-tasking program at any point.

The search function was powerful, allowing you to search for portions of assembler language instructions, strings and individual bytes in decimal or hexadecimal.

Interestingly, we have not found any advertising for this in the dedicated QL magazines!!

wikipage: Mordon's Quest
wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/classic_package.jpg|QL Classic Adventures|align="I"|Packaging for Sinclair QL Classic Adventures))%%%

According to the manual provided with the QL version, Mordon's Quest is a sequel to [The Adventure] (an improved implementation of the Crowther and Woods original).  However, other than being written by the same author, it appears that this statement is probably incorrect.  In fact, the adventure announces at the start that it is the first in the Mordon saga. At least one sequel, Bostafer's Revenge, was promised on other platforms, but never materialized. 

This implementation is text only and is based around the premise that you need to explore your world, gathering treasure and working out how to get around obstacles using the items which can be found littered about the game.  All the treasure has to be returned to the treasure room in order to complete the game.

The program was released on several other platforms, including the [Sinclair ZX Spectrum|http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseek.cgi?regexp=^Mordon%27s+Quest$&pub=^Melbourne+House$&loadpics=1], [Amstrad CPC|http://www.cpc-power.com/index.php?page=detail&num=1461], [Atari 8-Bit|http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-mordon-s-quest_3528.html], BBC Micro and [Commodore 64|http://www.gb64.com/game.php?id=5002].  

The QL version was never released on its own and only included as part of the QL Classic Adventures package by [Sinclair Research Ltd] which also featured [The Adventure].

Synopsis:
After many other hair-raising adventures, you finally wake from your dream to find "Mordon", the Ancient One, appearing before you shrouded in light. He seeks your help in desperation, and your quest is to retrieve all the lost components of his precious immortality machine and bring them to him. Your failure means the destruction of the universe. Success brings rewards unlimited.

Mortville Manor is an adventure based within a large house in France, where you play the role of the great detective, Jérôme Lange and have been invited to stay, only to find yourself in the middle of a mystery.

The scenario has a lot of atmosphere, although there are limited descriptions for each location - instead you have to rely on the pictures which are drawn and the interaction with other people around the house, if you are to solve the mystery.

The range of commands is more limited than normal, as this is suppose to be more interactive than a normal text adventure.  For example, enter the command OPEN and a small cursor appears on the screen for you to move and indicate which object you wish to open.

A challenging puzzle, this proved a great hit.

A later version was released for the Atari ST computer, with speech generation, with other versions for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga and DOS.

wikitext: Nebula II is a space travel and trading game from [Pyramide], originally written in French, although it has since been translated to English.

In the game you travel from planet to planet, buying and selling products and ore, making profit and taking advantage of the price variations in the solar system. 

Planets which are far from the centre are the most dangerous and expensive to access (cost of fuel, risk of being attacked by space pirates), but it are also where you can find the highest price variations, allowing you to make great bargains (whether selling or buying).
 
From a technical point of view, there are not many graphics: a representation of the planet, and a sequence with effects when travelling between planets. Beware attacks from  pirates, where the fight takes place in a very basic view from above, showing the spaceships. 

Once on a planet, you have a selection of options and places do go to (market hall, garage...), all with a text based interface, similar to an adventure.

It was then taken on by [Talent Computer Systems] who released it under their own label, but the original version contained a few bugs which meant that it could never be completed.  Later amended by [Rich Mellor] it was relaunched as Nemesis MKII and sold under the [RWAP Adventures] brand.

Nemesis is a text-only adventure based in space and you play the part of the hero, sent by the Council of Elders in the inner sanctum of the Federation of the Seven Galaxies, to seek and capture the most dangerous man in the galaxy, Nemesis.

A game rich in atmosphere and split into two distinct parts, it has a good range of puzzles to provide a distinct challenge to even hardened role-players.

Night Nurse was a colourful arcade adventure published by [Shadow Games] where you have to guide Nurse Gray around St Spooks hospital, avoiding randy doctors and Paranoid Pete as well as the forensic flu bug.

Pick up and use objects littered around the wards in your quest for the "Golden Prescription".

Basically, you have to find out the way to have fun and get invited to the party, instead of being an old stick in the mud.

With the program logic being written in SuperBASIC, with machine code sprites for the various characters, the original version of this was quite slow.  RWAP Software have improved the SuperBASIC to increase the speed and make this game playable, although it is let down somewhat by the flickering sprites.

The sprites were originally written using an early version of the [Super Sprite Generator] package - we have tried re-writing the SuperBASIC to use the latest version of the [Super Sprite Generator] package, but unfortunately, there seems to be some form of incompatability in the sprite files themselves, as they do not display on screen.

Nucleon is a suite of programs by [Pyramide] to help you create your own programs.

The package includes the following programs which are started from a simple main menu:

*__Compact Draw__ - a drawing program, that will then generate SuperBASIC code to recreate the picture.
*__Font Definer__ - a program to allow you to define your own fonts (character set) as well as icons for use on screen.  Once defined, you can then create a new boot program which allows you to install as many character sets and icons as you wish
*__Windows__ - an icon driven program to allow you to set up and adjust window channels on screen (including borders, shadow, colours, size and position).  It then creates the SuperBASIC code to set these up.
*__Maestro__ - a program to compose music using the QL's built in BEEP function - compose the notes on screen and then generate a SuperBASIC program to play the tune for you.
*__Integrator__ - a program to add machine code routines to the generated SuperBASIC program (all sections created by the above programs can be merged together into one program).

The package also includes machine code routines to compress the screen, swap between graphics screens, return the amount of free memory, access and use the fonts, paint an area of the screen, disable the break key and spray paint an area of the screen.

wikipage: Oasis MADC12LQ
wikitext: The __Oasis MADC12LQ__ was a special version of the OASIS analogue to digital precision instrument, created by Peter Nelson Design Consultancy, and marketed by Oasis Products from Norwich.

The MADC12LQ was advertised in the June 1985 edition of QL User, at a price of £499 plus VAT, with versions also for the BBC Model B and Apple II computers from £399 plus VAT upwards.  It is unknown what the QL version looked like, as the Apple II version is shown in the advert!

It could handle up to 16 channels.

The QL version included a hardware interface and data acquisition software on microdrive cartridge, which allowed export of the data for use within [ABACUS]. The QL was used to set up the number of channels required, change ranges, polarity and other settings, and then to initiate the scanning and process the returned data.

It is extremely rare.

OE Limited were the first company connected with the QL to fail in spectacular style with many early customers losing their money (maybe the name of the main module for connecting to the QL (then called the Q-Con) should have been a warning).

Luckily, [Tandata Marketing Limited] purchased the rights to this popular modem stack and brought it to market.

wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/omega_package.jpg|Omega for Sinclair QL|align="I"|Packaging for Sinclair QL Omega by Caret Computers))%%%

Omega is a 3D graphic adventure from the first person perspective.

This is an adventure where you play a mercenary (codename Omega) in the year 2156.  Your mission is to seek out and destroy a government computer which is hidden underground and well guarded.

You start off moving along roads, and have to tackle various flying creatures which attack on your travels.  You can enter houses and other items which are shown on your radar at the side of the screen. There are mazes and of course the enemy to contend with.

Unfortunately, there seems to be a bug in this program - we have tried both an early version compiled with SuperCharge, and a later version compiled with Turbo.  If you find an enemy and kill it, the program then just hangs.

Does anyone have a version which gets past this?

You play a series of 18 hole golf courses, and are presented with an overhead view of the golf course, along with details of wind speed and direction, and location of your ball.

You then have to control your direction, strength behind the shot and type of golf club used to strike your ball and try to beat the course record.

Unusually, this game includes a 3D image of the player and the course ahead and takes skill to master

wikipage: Operating Systems
wikitext: !!!Operating Systems

!!QDOS

The original Sinclair QL Disk Operating System produced by [Tony Tebby] and his team at Sinclair. The QL was originally to have included an operating system called 68K/OS by [GST Computer Systems] (which eventually became available separately). QDOS comes on ROM with a BASIC interpreter written by [Jan Jones|http://www.jan-jones.co.uk/aboutme.html].

QDOS is a single user multitasking system, although it does not have built in windowing software. This can be added by means of something called the Pointer Environment by Tony Tebby's team at software house [QJump].

The original QDOS was shipped on an outside EPROM board which came to be known as a "Kludge". This was quickly replaced with internal ROMs or EPROMs. QDOS version numbers are used, usually version 1.xy for the various ROM versions. More commonly, ROM versions were identified by the 2 or 3 letter SuperBASIC version identifier, such as FB, AH, JM, JS and MG in that order of age. Various international versions were also released with a third letter denoting the intended national variant, such as JSU for the United States of America.

QL ROM images may be freely copied nowadays, apart from in North America where the rights are still held by Paul Holmgren and Frank Davies. ROM images may be downloaded from [http://www.dilwyn.uk6.net/gen/qlroms/qlroms.html], although North American users should seek permission for use from one of the copyright holders listed above.

!!68K/OS

68K/OS was an operating system designed by GST Computer Systems Ltd for the QL, but which was replaced by QDOS before the QL was launched. GST did have aspirations to make this a 'de facto' operating system for the 68000 processor series and OEM markets, though it is not known how far they got.

68K/OS was advertised by GST in late 1984 as an add-on for the QL. It consisted of a plug-in card containing a switch to let you select QDOS or 68K/OS. It came with sizeable manuals (including an applications programmer's manual) and software on two microdrives, including an editor and file maintenance programs. The 68K/ASM assembler  and systems programmer's manual were extra, at £39.95 and £4.95 respectively.

The board included two spare EPROM slots for applications software. The operating system allowed for real-time multitasked software with multiple screen windows and somehow made microdrive access times much faster.

68K/OS did not include a BASIC interpreter, although it had a simple command line interpreter called ADAM.

Upon launch, 68K/OS cost a whopping £99.95.


!!Minerva

This was an update to QDOS, produced by the team of Stuart McKnight, Jonathan Oakley and Laurence Reeves at QView. More recently, Minerva has been marketed by Tony Firshman at TF Services. Minerva is a complete rewrite of QDOS, removing a lot of bugs which came to light in QDOS over the years. Indeed, it is so different to QDOS in coding terms that some consider it a different operating system.

Minerva is available in two versions, the original is a straightforward 48K EPROM upgrade for the QL, while the Minerva Mk II is a more complex beast which supports additional facilities like an I²C bus system for connection of external hardware.

!!Argos

A rewrite of QDOS by CST for use with the Thor range of QL compatible computers. Includes a windowing system which is largely incompatible with QL pointer environment.

!!SMS2 – Small Micro Systems

A plug-in cartridge for Atari ST computers written by Tony Tebby and distributed by Furst Ltd. No BASIC interpreter was included in this operating system.


!!SMSQ

A form of SMSQ/E without pointer environment, produced by Tony Tebby for Miracle Systems for the QXL card. No inbuilt pointer environment and largely superceded by a version of SMSQ/E for QXL.

!!SMSQ/E

Standing for Single-user Multitasking System QL/Extended environment, this is Tony Tebby's updated operating system for the various QL and QL compatible platforms. It is available in versions for QL with Gold/Super Gold Cards, Atari ST, QXL, Q40, Q60 and Aurora systems. It has been included int he QPC emulator by Marcel Kilgus, and recent versions of the QemuLator QL emulator for Windows systems by Daniele Terdina can run the Gold Card version of SMSQ/E. SMSQ/E has built in equivalent of the QL pointer environment and the operating system builds on QDOS and adds a great deal of features to the original QL operating system, while managing to maintain a high degree of compatibility with existing QL software. More recently, SMSQ/E has acquired built in support for high resolution displays and for 8-bit and 16-bit colour support on Aurora, Q40, Q60, QPC2 and QXL.

wikipage: Orbit
wikitext: Orbit was originally commissioned by Sinclair Research Limited but was never published.

The game was meant to be a orbital fighting game with realistic orbital physics but only in 2D.  The authors had lots of trouble getting the physics engine to work quickly enough on the old QL and enforce some level of stable orbits and still be playable. It would appear that Sinclair sold all of the rights to Amstra before the game was finished and it therefore was left in abeyance.

[RWAP Software|http://www.rwapsoftware.co.uk] have obtained the rights to release the game in 2014, with thanks to Steven Hollywood - with royalties payable to Unicef.

wikipage: OScard
wikitext: The OScard was supplied by [Quest Automation Ltd] and supplied the necessary memory switch and RAM capacity required in order to run their [CP/M 68K Operating System].  The card pictured in their adverts is marked 'MPC Module' (Issue A) - however, we have also seen a similar looking card called 'OS Module' (Issue C) - so it is uncertain if these provided different functions or were one and the same (Quest never advertised an MPC Module so far as we know.

The OSCard only appears to contain a 1K RAM chip, plus lots of glue logic:

* 7805 voltage regulator
* 74LS133 13-input NAND gate
* 74LS14 hex Schmitt trigger inverter
* 74LS14 hex Schmitt trigger inverter
* 7416 hex inverter buffer/driver with 15 V open collector outputs
* 74LS133 13-input NAND gate
* MOSTEK MK4801AN / MK4118A 1k x 8 SRAM
* 74LS14 hex Schmitt trigger inverter
* SN74LS74AN: Dual D Type Flip Flop
* 74LS14 hex Schmitt trigger inverter
* 74LS32 quad 2-input OR gate

The OScard could be used on its own (allowing you to run CP/M-68K from microdrive cartridge), or came pre-fitted inside the [Quest Floppy Disk Drive] interface.

Interestingly it appears to allow the [CP/M 68K Operating System] to share some QDOS routines and facilities rather than re-writing the whole operating system.

Paint Master is a graphics package from [Shadow Games] which allows you to use colours, stipples and text, together with automated shapes to create your own pictures.  

Advertised features were:

*Use of all colours, stipples and text
*Automatic drawing of many geometric shapes
*Superimposed grid for guidance
*Powerful duplicate facility which reproduces any object in any size, at any position and as many times as you want
*Variable picture size
*Redraw facility
*Erasure of last command

The program creates a set of SuperBASIC commands which would re-create your drawing on screen, meaning that it was easy to delete the last command if you made a mistake, but the final picture was slow.

The package includes a mini text and graphics adventure to show how the resulting output could be incorporated within your own programs.

The author was working on Paint Master II but it is unknown if this was ever completed.

This is a bitmap drawing program produced by [Pyramide] which was controlled through a series of icons.

Quite a neat utility, this provides the most common commands you require. Only handles standard QL screen modes (4 and 8colours).  Alas it cannot handle 512 x 256 pixels and can only handle (384 x 216 pixels) meaning that screens are only 27648 bytes in length (compared to the normal 32768 bytes) - the program expects these screens to have an extension of _Qsc.  

However, the screens can be loaded directly to the QL's screen memory although they only show as 216 lines of pixels, rather than the original 256 lines.  The 384 pixel display by the program is given black edges on either side.

wikitext: This is an arcade game which was originally published by [ABC Elektronic] and [Gigasoft] but has now been re-released by [RWAP Software].

In this colourful game, you control a small Penguin (Pengi) as he tries to survive the antarctic climate, trapped inside a maze of ice blocks, surrounded by an electric fence.  Faced with deadly snobees all around, the only way to survive is by pushing ice blocks onto the snobees and squashing them, before they touch Pengi.  You can also collect diamonds to gain additional points and stun the snobees by hitting them with the blue ice walls. 

Based on the Sega Arcade game, Pengo, similar versions were released by Visions Software for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron.

The game is written entirely in 68000 machine code.

wikipage: Perfection
wikitext: Perfection was an attempt to re-invent the QL's approach to Word Processing - with the friendliness of and similar user interface to [Quill] but with a host more features, and in particular a huge speed improvement.

The program was written to [Freddy Vaccha]'s design and overall specification, with the detailed specification devised between Freddy and the main programmer on the project, [Steve Sutton].

Freddy says "Implementation (i.e. writing) of the main body of code was all by [Steve Sutton]; conversely, all the spell-checking / dictionary maintenance stuff was written by me.  I'd considered using [Peter Jefferies] for this, but - note this was a very much younger and less experienced Peter then - when we tried it out, he was too disorganised for a software ultra-planner like me."

The program was certainly very quick at navigation and when searching / replacing words or phrases in the program.  Indeed, Freddy comments "I think there's a fair probability that the idea behind PERFECTION's memory management (think inserting material at high speed into the middle of a huge document) was "borrowed" by certain large U.S. software corporations whose names you would know.  As the expanded QL's hardware ran at less than 1/10,000th of the raw speed of what we can easily buy now, that it could handle (say) the KJV Bible without noticeable delays was some achievement.  Of all my/our/DP's work, it is the one of which I am proudest."

PASCAL (named after the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal) was designed in 1968/9 and published in 1970 by Niklaus Wirth as a small and efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring.  Each variable has to be associated with a type (such as CHAR, INTEGER or REAL), but copying between data types generally causes an error, limiting the language's flexibility.

Pascal's ability to enumerate types and form complex data structures makes it suitable for structured data processing and arithmetic, algorithmic problems.

Advertised features included:
*Interlinkable code meant you could use programs which used both Pro Pascal and [Pro Fortran-77] code
*Single and double precision IEEE format arithmetic gives 7 or 16 digit precision.

Using this database, the program attempted to predict the outcome of forthcoming fixtures - both scoredraws and no scores.

A later version appears to have been released - Super Pro Poolster, which we have managed to save.

The Pointer Environment mouse interface ([QIMI] or similar) is not supported.

Professional Publisher unfortunately does not support directories during configuration and still only supports a single page design. The file "variable_default" must always be present in the root directory of the medium, where the program sits. So, if one wants to put all the files of Professional Publisher in a directory, say "win1_ProPub_", the file "publish_task" must be searched for a string "variable_default", then the string changed to "ProPub_e_default". Of course, the file "variable_default" has then to be put in the directory "win1_ProPub_" and the filename changed to "e_default". Length of the directoryname plus filename has to be identical to "Variable_default".

Profiting from the Sinclair QL is designed to help users get the most out of the Psion Abacus spreadsheet program supplied with the Sinclair QL.

Emphasis is placed on the practical business of making the computer do most of the work and exploiting the capabilities of Abacus.

A useful guide to take you beyond the basics, this book forms part of the QL Series of books, which formed the mainstay of many a QL'ers library in the early days.

wikipage: ProForma ESC/P2 Drivers
wikitext: The ProForma ESC/P2 Drivers from [RWAP Software] provide up to 720dpi full colour printing to ESC/P2 compatible printers (or to a modern printer if you have QPCPrint on your PC), from within LineDesign and any other ProWeSs based programs.

As well as providing high-speed output in both monochrome and full colour mode, you can choose to print using 180dpi, 360dpi or 720dpi.  There is also standard colour printing and a colour replacement driver for use with LineDesign.

Rich Mellor says
>"This was an interesting exercise at the time - it was actually my first foray into C programming (!) - I took the original Epson printer driver from Progs as a source and then re-wrote the C code to ignore blank lines and use TIFF binary compression to produce high speed printing; as well as adding the 720dpi mode.

> It taught me a lot about Epson printers as well as C programming."

Also included in the sources is an attempt to program the 1440dpi mode - however, for some reason, this does not work - we can only assume that there was something different in how Epson printers handle this print mode.

This package was released into public domain as part of the RWAP Software 30th Anniversary celebrations.

wikipage: Psion
wikitext: Psion was initially awarded the contract to write the suite of office programs for the Sinclair QL's release and went on to produce some excellent games and programs for the QL.

The development team included the chairman David Potter, technical director Charles Davies and software director Colly Myers.

Psion software have since expanded into mobile phone software and are now a PLC listed on the London Stock Exchange.

The software published by Psion includes:


* [Abacus] (Menu driven spreadsheet program)
* [Archive] (Menu driven database program)
* [ArchDEV/ArchRTM] (Development package for programs written for [Archive])
* [Easel] (Menu driven graph drawing program)
* [Match Point] (3D Tennis Program)
* [Psion Chess] (3D Chess Program)
* [QDraw] (Bitmap drawing package)
* [Quill] (Menu driven Wordprocessor)
* [Xchange] (Business suite which combined the above 4 programs)

Interestingly, the September 1985 issue of QL User refers to Psion working on a third simulation which they understood would be a flight simulator on a par with, if not better than [Sub-Logic's bestseller on the IBM PC|http://www.volny.cz/havlikjosef/historyenglish1.htm].  However, the first versions were intended for the Atari ST, although this never appears to have been published on any machine.

This is the original chess program for the QL, written by Richard Lang and launched by [Psion], it was originally published on the [Sinclair Research Ltd] label and later under [Psion]'s own label.

Psion Chess played a very strong game at the time and was famous for its 3D board display.  A version of Psion Chess (running on a full 32-bit Sage computer) shared first place with three dedicated computer chess machines at the 4th World Micro Computer Chess Championships in 1984/5.

Interestingly, the September 1985 issue of QL User showed how the program could be defeated using the Queen's Gambit opening.

The game was written entirely in 68000 machine code by [Richard Lang], who had a lot of experience writing chess program for the Z80 and other systems. Psion chess for the Sinclair QL was, however, his first 68000 implementation. The 3D board and interface was written by Psion.

A version was also available for DOS based systems, the Apple Mac and Atari computers.

Publishing Off-ICE (also known as Page-Making-Off-ICE) is a type of desktop publishing program, although it can only handle text and graphics as generated by the constituent programs supplied as part of Publishing Off-ICE.

It requires the [ICE] pointer environment complete with Mouse.

The program includes the following tools to help produce the parts of a page, which are then overlaid on top of each other to create the page: 

- 3D Graphics program - able to draw 3D blocks, triangles and lenses, with a user defined viewpoint and in solid / wireframe graphics.
- 2D Graphics program - able to draw line, arc, circles/ellipses, rectangles and triangles
- Char-Block - a program to allow you to layout text within a user defined rectangle.  You can use this to enter user defined characters into the block also.
- A text editor - this handles a typewriter mode for text entry and you can then transform the text into columns.
- A bitmap graphics program ([ArtICE])
- Printer output to Cannon / Taxan / Epson compatible printers.

The manual appears as a Quill DOC on the disk.

Not the easiest to use Desktop Publishing Program.

This game is loosely based on the old favourite Boulderdash, in that you need to find your way through various screens, each of which forms a puzzle.

You are up against both a timer and a bomb which is about to go off on each screen.  You have to feed all of the nuclear waste into the macerators before the bomb explodes, but in order to do so, you need to move boulders about the screen in order to clear your pathways.

Excellent graphics and not easy to complete.

wikitext: Pyramide was a French software house, based in Paris, set up by Daniel Purlich in November 1985 to produce programs for the Sinclair QL, some of which were highly innovative, such as Mortville Manor, the first graphic adventure for the Sinclair QL (and possibly any home computer) and the infamous QL Wanderer which was played in 3D (with 3D glasses required).

Pyramide were profiled in the October 1986 edition of Sinclair QL World, at which point their catalogue included 13 titles in French and 6 titles in English.  They also used a UK distributor - RIO Promotions Limited.

Pyramide produced various games for the Sinclair QL but did not last and many of its titles were converted for other computers by Lankhor.

The software published by Pyramide includes:


* [Clavier AZERTY] (Toolkit to change AH, JM and JS ROMs to support AZERTY keyboard layout)
* [Graphic Toolkit] (Range of additional commands for making the most of the QL's screen and graphics).
* [Illusions] - MISSING IN ACTION
* [Mister Smith] (Arcade game where you make bubbles to kill your enemies - MISSING IN ACTION)
* [Mortville Manor] (Graphic Adventure set around solving a murder)
* [Nebula II] - (Space trading game)
* [Nucleon] (Set of programming utilities)
* [Othello] (The classic board game in 3D)
* [Peintre] (Icon driven graphics drawing program)
* [QL Remember] - MISSING IN ACTION
* [QLovis] - MISSING IN ACTION
* [Super Croupier] (Various casino games in one - MISSING IN ACTION)

* [Troll] (Role Playing Adventure Game Editor and Interpreter)
* [Vroom] (Formula 1 Car racing game)
* [QL Wanderer] (Space trading game in 3D)

They also produced a series of packages of small utilities and games, sold as [Bag of Tricks] - we have preserved copies of Bag of Tricks 1 and 2, but understand that there were 7 sets in total!

Pyramide also acquired the rights to a disk drive system - see [Pyramide Disc System]

wikitext: The Pyramide QL Disk was intended originally for release by French company Direco, the rights to this device was acquired by French software company [Pyramide]. 

This was a single drive system with its own disk interface, toolkit and 12V power supply. The system connects as an inline assembly to the left of the QL via the expansion slot. Connection of a second drive via a short ribbon cable is also possible. 

This drive was a 360K 40 track double sided 3.5 inch unit. 

The software supported French or English system prompts. 

The toolkit is not quite the same as the usual Toolkit 2 style commands. The device name was "fld" in contrast to the more common "flp".

*Physics (Q-PHYS) was advertised as containing 89K of raw data in 80 files.
*Chemistry (Q-CHEM) said to cover most of all syllabuses
*History (Q-HIST) covered subjects including Disraeli, the Eastern Question (1874-8), Liberals (1904-14), Salisbury, Parliamentary Reform, Clash with the Lords, Women and the Vote, Trade Unions, and WWI (Western Front, Causes, at Sea, against Turkey and at Home), spread across 111 files.
*French Verbs (Q-VERB) - covering regular, irregular, reflexive verbs.  It includes a special line editor which allows accents to be added/changed/removed on screen as you type.  Verbs, tenses and persons can each be selected by the user or generated randomly.

The program forces students to revise in a structured manner, by allowing them to zoom in on a particular section of the course.

The program was also supplied with machine code extensions for SuperBASIC giving file handling, screen access and display procedures (presumably used in the QREV program)

This software basically sets up a phone book file, which enables you to enter or find users by name, and you can then dial that user's computer over the modem.  Of course, you can set up a user to be a standard BBS system.  You can also store the communications protocols for that user's computer (the standard Prestel format are assumed by default).

With the Q-Call module (auto-dialling), select option 1 from the menu to automatically dial and connect to the chosen user's computer.  Without the Q-Call module attached, you are shown the user's name and number and asked to dial manually.

wikipage: Q-Flash Ram Disk
wikitext: Q-Flash was designed to be the fastest RAM disk for the Sinclair QL at the time.  

A ram disk is a virtual disk drive which is stored in the QL's memory providing much quicker access than a microdrive cartridge, or floppy disk drive, or even the QL hard disks.

It was also the first RAM disk which did not have to be pre-formatted before use and would dynamically adapt to ensure it was large enough for the files being copied to it.

The Q-Flash RAM disk also contains a command MDVLOAD to load the whole content of a Microdrive cartridge into a RAM disk in one go. A similar process was also built in later in Tony Tebby's RAM disk (with printer buffer) "Ramprt", when Qram was launched.

Advertised features included:
- The ultimate in speed, reliability, features and compatability
- Seven times faster than other RAM disks : QL Screen image (32768 bytes) loads in 0.15 seconds!
- I/O intensive programs run up to 100 times faster
- No bugs reported since initial release in August 1985
- Full dynamic memory allocation - no FORMAT command necessary.  No memory reserved for file data unless really used for your files
- Up to 8 RAM devices can be used with up to 255 files per device
- Works on standard (128K) QL and with all QL software, and takes full advantage of expansion memory up to the 640K maximum
- JUst as easy to use as microdrives or floppies, but much faster.

wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/Q-Liberator_package.png|Q-Liberator SuperBASIC Compiler for Sinclair QL|align="I"|Packaging for Sinclair QL Q-Liberator))%%%
Q-Liberator is the work of Ian Stewart and Adrian Soundy at [Liberation Software]. It is a compiler which compiles to a form of intermediate p-code, meaning it can never be as fast as true compilers which compile to machine code, but in practice fast enough for 99% of applications. 

It is able to compile the full syntax of SuperBASIC quite closely, with a good tolerance of badly written programs.

There are two versions in existence, the original 'Budget' version and the current version 3 (last known version 3.36). It comes with an extensive manual, and may be purchased from [Q-Branch] or [Jochen Merz Software]. The Budget' version is no longer available, but has the advantage of working on unexpanded memory QL systems. 

QLiberator is also easily able to compile pointer driven programs and those making use of QPTR, something which has only been added to [Turbo] since it was made freeware.

wikipage: Q-Power Regulator
wikitext: Q-Power Regulator was designed by [SPEM] and sold by [Sandy]. It is a plug in replacement for the 5 volt internal regulator which generated the heat behind the microdrive housing and could cause lockups on expanded QL. Fitted in minutes with just a screwdriver, it provided a high frequency switching output for cooler trouble free running.

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/hardware/qpower_regulator.jpg|Qpower Regulator|align="i"|Sandy Qpower Regulator|240|194|POPUP))

While fine with older interfaces, this was known not to work with the Gold Card, which needed a surge of power at switch-on which was dampened by this regulator.

__WARNING:__ We have seen at least two models of this regulator and certainly at least one of these has a tendency to overheat and may catch fire!  [Tony Firshman] also reports having seen three at least which have caused voltage surges and destroyed QLs and peripherals.

wikipage: Q-Route
wikitext: Q-Route is based on an Atari ST program (Route Finder by Brian Henderson) and allows you to find the best route between two places, using the map of Britain supplied. You can find the shortest or quickest route and display it graphically on screen or as a list of the roads which you need to take. 

The on-screen map is generated from the database of roads, which avoids some of the common problems with other Route Finder software, where the map may show you a different route to the printed directions.

You can enter your own preferences for speeds on the various road types and even ask the program to find a route which avoids certain roads or places. The final output can be printed directly from the program (or through another package if you wish) and the program supports Text87, Perfection, Xchange and Quill printer drivers, so there is little setting up to be done.

As well as the standard Britain map, various other maps have been created for use with the program:%%%
* BIG Britain Map (more details)
* Scotland Area Map

* South & West Yorkshire Area Map

wikitext: Q-Time is mentioned in the Summer Software Survey (September 1985 issue of QL User) and is described as a time keeping package for solicitors [Q-Time] which was reported as including a QL and monitor, for use purely as a time logging system.

It is presumed that Q-Time worked along the standard Solicitor's billing system - whereby each hour is split up into units (nominally 6 minutes), and when working on a file, the solicitor would keep a note of the number of units spent on the file and whether they were billable units.

wikipage: Q40
wikitext: The Q40 was a complete replacement for the Sinclair QL home computer.

Based around a Motorola 68040 processor (as used in the [Super Gold Card]), the Q40 was designed by Peter Graf in Germany and used a custom designed motherboard, with a standard PC I/O daughterboard for handling communications with the hard disk, floppy disk drives and serial ports.

Although supplied with SMSQ/e on EPROM, the Q40 could also run [QDOS Classic] or even its own version of Linux.  Unfortunately, versions of SMSQ/e later than v3.10 are now too large to fit on EPROM and have to be loaded from the hard disk.

The Q40 was designed to fit into a PC-style AT case, using standard PC parts such as floppy disk drives, hard disks, keyboards, PC power supply, monitors and so on. The computer could have from 16MB to 128MB of RAM and came with 256K of ROM.

The Q40 not only supports the standard Sinclair QL screen mode (512x256 pixels in 4 or 8 colours), but thanks to the latest SMSQ/e, it supports up to 65536 colours at a screen resolution of 1024x512 pixels. Along with that, came support for sampled sound playback, up to 20kHz using the Unsigned Byte (.ub) sound file format; up to 2 floppy disk drives and 2 hard disks (or a hard disk and CD-ROM); up to 2 serial ports and a parallel printer port. It had a slot for PC-style ISA add-on cards, although most fo these would have required QL drivers of course.

Initially only available as a motherboard for building into a system of your choice, it was later made available as a complete ready built computer by Derek Stewart and Dennis Smith of D&D Systems in England.

wikipage: QBert
wikitext: QBert was an early release by New Horizons Software of Newport, Gwent.  First advertised in April 1985, by July 1985, it was being sold under the name, Z-Fred.

QBert is a game whereby you have to jump across a series of blocks which are linked together to form a pyramid - the task is simply to visit every block (as you jump, you leave a painted trail behind you).  At the same time, things are rolled down the pyramid at you and will kill you.

This appears to be the [Zfred] game which was eventually released on the Sinclair QL Games cartridge supplied by Sinclair free from 1986 onwards, which is credited to New Horizons.

However, the original game is missing in action and therefore we cannot be certain.

The program included a library of 97 standard electronic symbols, including capacitors, op amps, diodes, transformers and a range of IC pin-outs in a variety of package types.

You could use the included program QCOMP to add your own libraries.

Advertised features included:
*Supplied complete with user manual
*Extended electronic symbol set
*High resolution screen dumps to most printers
*Set and manipulate symbols - move - copy, etc
*Save and load diagrams
*Back up service included
*Unprotected software to transfer to any media
*Design your own symbol set

We assume this is the package mentioned in QL User (November 1985) as QLCAD

We have come across some correspondence which suggests that this program may have been withdrawn by Strong due to a bug in the "compiler".

Unlike some of the drawing packages, QDraw allows you to edit the full screen and works in both mode 4 and mode 8 drawing with a pen of varying thickness.  You could also draw lines using rubber band techniques and magnify the screen.  

Although there were no built in functions to draw rectangles, triangles etc, you could define a shape on screen by enclosing an area with lines.  The shape could then be saved to form a library of shapes which you could fill, move around the screen, replicate the shape and drop a shadow.

It is a folder/icon based desktop environment, similar in principle and appearance to those on other operating systems. It supports drag and drop of objects, file associations, configuration notebook and makes full use of the SMSQ/E operating system and multi-tasking.

An IconDraw utility allows a user to draw or modify icons and allows a user to import icons from different systems

A Job Manager lists running and sleeping jobs. Filters can limit visible jobs. 
The Job Manager allows job manipulation 

A Theme Manager allows designing of a desktop and folder color and background theme and allows users to import and share their theme designs.

The Installer automatically installs the QDT program, can setup a minimal or expanded desktop automatically and includes object (program) search and setup

QDT is too big a project to describe in brief here - for more information and sample screen dumps visit the author's website at [http://www.jdh-stech.com|http://www.jdh-stech.com]

About the only limitation I can think of is that QDT does not run on older systems or on 4 colour displays. But then, QDT is designed to be used on high colour systems to make maximum use of the resources available to us on modern QL compatible systems.

The latest version can be found on The Distribution, see [DVDs].

It has an onboard rom containing its system firmware.

QEPIII provides verification of eproms at 4V, 4.3V, 4.7V, 5V, 5.3V, 5.7V and 6V - under and over voltage verification being essential for reliable eprom service. It also features fats programming at voltages of 12.7V, 21V and 25V. It can program Eproms from 16K to 512K with standard pinouts, or the data and address pins may be re-assigned for ease of PCB layout. The programming software is included in an onboard EPROM, and is menu driven for ease of operation. It is invoked by the command "EPROM". But....it can also be multitasked by "EPROM_M".

QIMI stands for QL Internal Mouse Interface, the original QJump pointer interface mouse system for the QL. It is fitted onto the main QL motherboard, with no soldering required. QIMI is automatically recognised by the pointer interface, so the mouse can be used with any pointer driven software.

Installation involved removing one of the Sinclair ROM chips (the upper address one labelled 8000) and the ZX8302 and fitting those to the QIMI board.

The QIMI interface could also be supplied with battery backup for the QL's real time clock, which QJump claimed had the added benefit of suppressing the glitches which reset the clock on power-up, and proved to be up to 50 times more reliable than simple battery backup systems.

The QIMI worked only with a BUS mouse - such as that supplied with Atari systems.

The QIMI interface was later supplied by Quanta.

wikipage: QL APL
wikitext: APL is a very high-level language used for financial and mathematical modelling, although it can be used for many other purposes. It is particularly noted for its ability to process arrays as easily and quickly as scalar variables.

APL was named after the book 'A programming language' by Kenneth E. Iverson (1962) and is a high-level interpreter language designed for non-computer professionals.

APL provides extremely powerful, but simple array handling facilities, which dispense with counts and loops, resulting in very compact code - for example, to add all of the elements in two arrays (A) and (B), you would simply use:
>"A + B"

Two versions of APL were produced - the symbolic version (which is based on the standard APL statements made up of Greek letters and overstrike characters, and not easy to use on a standard English keyboard) and a Keyword version which allows the use of proper keyword functions for each APL statement.

MicroAPL Limited produced both versions for the QL, which are based on the IBM compatible version of APL by the same company. 

The symbolic version used the conventional APL character set; the other replaced the special symbols by mnemonic keywords, such as "index" for the iota. The implementation is complete for the original version of the language.

QL APL runs on an unexpanded machine with the aid of a ROM cartridge. This contains the parser and is the only part of the program to differ between the two versions. The program can run on any emulator or QL-compatible system which emulates the ROM port, since that code on the cartridge is not relocatable.

Both versions occupied 95K of memory and did not implement some of the more advanced APL.68000 features, nor multi-user filing features.  However there were extensions to take account of the QL's in-built hardware, such as colour, windows, redirection of output, sound and graphics.  Thankfully, the keyword version implements the IF command which works the same way as the APL '/' operator, but with the arguments reversed, so that it makes more logical sense to an inexperienced programmer.

QL Assembler was written by [GST Computer Systems] and published on the [Sinclair Research Ltd] label.

The program is a standard 68008 motorola assembler (later upgraded to create a [QL Macro Assembler]), which actually came complete with the editor used in the [Metacomco Assembler]!

The assembler includes an integral linker, and supports INCLUDE directives (for example to make use of the standard library routines included on the microdrive).

Although QL Assembler can assemble larger files than the [Metacomco Assembler], the interface is not as user friendly - as you just use a command line to tell the assembler what file to assemble, what listing to produce and include numerous assembler options.

A useful public domain utility [AREF2|http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/asm/aref2.zip] was later written by H.P.Recktenwald which generates cross-references for the text sources supported by GST's QL Assembler.

The program was released as freeware in 2012.

wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/books/0-07084-777-0.jpg|QL Assembly Language Programming|align="I"|QL Assembly Language Programming by Colin Opie))%%%
QL Assembly Language Programming is an advanced technical guide to 68000 assembly language and QDOS.

The book was written by Colin Opie with the assistance of [Tony Tebby] and is intended for use with McGraw-Hill's 68000 assembler / editor package, which was sold separately for £29.95

The book covers the 68000 processor itself, with its instructions and addressing modes, QDOS calls and has a number of chapters full of example programs.

McGraw-Hill's 68000 editor is written in SuperBASIC. Its line management works with an array. To add and/or delete lines, the editor uses a resident extension

 ROOM_BIN

containing two resident procedures

 MAKE_ROOM
 TAKE_ROOM

written by Tony Tebby, which is used to insert ("MAKE_ROOM") or delete ("TAKE_ROOM") a line within the array "on the fly" without losing content. This extension seems to be the first one used for such purposes, written in 1984.

ROOM_BIN was later used by Tony Tebby's own "inhouse" editor "sedit", and "sedit" (which seems to be the prototype for the McGraw-Hill editor) was much later rewritten by Ralf Reköndt with new resident heap extensions and released as "S_Edit", marketed by Dilwyn Jones, now freeware.

__QL Bank Account by K J Gouldstone__

A small advert in the back of QL User (June 1985) heralded this software which was said to hold standing orders and allow full screen entry of all bank transactions.

It was listed in Sinclair User as __QL Bank Accounts System__

Included enquiry, analysis, printed statements and on-line help and was based on their earlier ZX Spectrum Bank Account System.  QL Bank Account System is designed to provide all the information you need about the state of your bank account. 

The system is built round the transaction, which consists of a computer defined number, a transaction type code (debit card, cheque etc), the date, a six figure reference number, a 15-character description, the amount, and an analysis code. 

The amount is entered in pence, which heralds from the Spectrum version. Up to 10 analysis codes with descriptions 
can be used and, via the transaction analysis option, show the total and average expenditure for each group. 

An Enquiry option offers a range of details which can be displayed on the screen or printed and then a statement can be printed which shows the date, type, reference number, description, amount and balance for transactions from a given 
date.

QL Cash Trader was originally released in 1984 for the Sinclair QL by [Accounting Software Limited] directly, and then released through [Sinclair Research Ltd] just one year later.  It then appears that this company was taken over by [Quest Automation Ltd] who released it as Trading Accounts with minimal changes.%%%
((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/QL_CashTrader_2_1.jpg|QL Cash Trader Leaflet by Sinclair|align="r"|Leaflet for Sinclair QL QL Cash Trader|212|300|POPUP)) 

The main program was originally supplied on its own for £75, with an Extracted Reports module for an extra £50.  That reports module was included in the version supplied by [Sinclair Research Ltd] for a total package price of £69.95.

The program works as a cash accounting system, providing simple double entry book keeping and VAT returns for a small business. As you enter transactions, the Profit & Loss and Balance Sheet figures are instantly updated and shown in a window above the input area.

There is a comprehensive manual supplied with the software, and also a simple sequence of learning and training exercises to help you get used to the software before setting it up for your own business.

QL Cash Trader allows you to keep track of your accounts, prepare trial balances and final accounts, all handled semi-automatically. No need to work this all out on paper anymore! It includes an easy-to-enter accounting routine with instant Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss a/c, VAT report, VAT return and trial balance.

Quest were originally planning bolt-on modules for Cash Trader, including more detailed analysis of profit and loss and balance sheet, as well as an invoicing module.  They also developed Cash Trader for the IBM PC and other machines, such as the Apple IIe and Apple IIc, Apricot and F1, the Amstrad and the Epson PX-8 (certainly there appears to have been a version released for the Amstrad PCW).

When Quest Automation Limited disappeared from the Sinclair QL scene, [Chas Dillon] was asked to re-write the software for [PDQL], which he did, with minor changes to the data formats.  He also released a reporting module (CT-Analyser) and made the program much quicker, compiling it with Turbo.

[PDQL] also produced their own improved version of Cash Trader called (again) [Trading Accounts] - although all of these features were later encompassed into the version QL Cash Trader as it has survived today.  Unfortunately, the other bolt-on modules planned by Quest do not appear to have ever been released.

Eventually, the rights to market the software transferred to [Digital Precision Ltd], although the software was still supported by Chas Dillon.  Following the withdrawal of Digital Precision from the QL market, Chas agreed to release the source code for Cash Trader as public domain, subject to no-one else making a profit from his sources.

[RWAP Software] then took on the mantle of Chas Dillon's version of this software, making changes to get around the millenium bug and correcting a few minor errors, adding password protection and minor improvements.  [RWAP Software] then sold this enhanced version for a nominal amount, to cover the costs of continuing to support the software.

This version includes the Analyser module which enables you to analyse accounts for management and auditing purposes (analyse all ledgers by date or by expense type). This can also be used to provide daily summaries and bank reconciliations.

This version was then released as public domain as part of the RWAP Software's 30th Anniversary celebrations in 2016 - again, subject to the proviso stated by Chas Dillon, that no-one else is allowed to make a profit from the sources. 

An interesting side note on this software (and possibly one of the biggest legacies for the QL), is how it has inspired other accountancy packages.  According to one source, a copy of the original program was purchased by one person, who liked the user-friendly interface so much that they designed the original Sage Accountancy program on Cash Trader.  There also remains a PC accounting package (specifically aimed at pension funds) which was created based on the original Accounting Systems Limited version [Visit M-P Systems website|http://www.m-psystems.co.uk/|eng|M-P Systems Pension Fund Accounting Package]

QL Cavern is the first of three QL games from [Janko Mrsic-Flögel] featuring the character BJ (the other two being [BJ Returns] and [BJ In 3D Land]).

This one was published by [Sinclair Research Ltd], the other two by [Eidersoft].  Its original title appears to have been BJ in Space, but was changed before release (some early copies still had this title on a splash screen!)

The objective of the game is to guide the character BJ around 50 caverns collecting 395 diamonds from the various rooms, while avoiding death by one of the monsters and deadly obstacles.  You move BJ using the cursor keys to move left and right, jump and crawl.  Trampolines, lifts, jet-packs and teleports help you move between sections of the screen (and to hidden screens).  Parachutes can be helpful if you have to fall a long distance, and there are plenty of extra lives on screen (if you can get to them!)

Featuring excellent graphics and background sound (which can be turned off) and the game is controlled by cursor keys or cursor emulating joystick. This was one of the early games which hinted that the QL could be a games machine when required.

wikipage: QL Compendium
wikitext: QL Compendium was a set of 6 programs for the Sinclair QL published by [Equate]

Fairly basic programs, the titles were:

*Solar Invaders - a version of space invaders for 1 to 4 players
*Wall-breaker - a version of breakout (1 to 4 players, with 5 levels of difficulty)
*Draughts - a version of the Board game, Draughts (1 or 2 players)
*Mined Your Path - a version of minesweeper - find the mines in the minefield (for 1 to 4 players, with 10 difficulty levels)
*Statistical Averages - calculates standard deviation, geometric mean, median etc.
*Calendar - Generates a calendar for any month of the year and calculates Easter.

I wonder if there was a link between this and the [Games Compendium] published by [Cwm Mawr Products] as there seems to be some overlap.

wikipage: QL Front Ends
wikitext: !!!QL FRONT ENDS (GUI)

Most computers these days have some form of "front end" on their operating systems and QLs are no exception.

There have been various attempts at some forms of front ends from the very early days of the QL. Rumours abounded from day 1 that [Sinclair Research Ltd] had sought co-operation with the company which produced the GEM desktop (known from the ATARI ST/TT/Falcon range of computers and from the PC) to put a version on a QL, although this project never reached fruition.

Early attempts included software such as [ICE] (standing for Icon Controlled Environment) from [Eidersoft], [QATS] (QL Application Traffic Supervisor) and [E.A.S.E]. Some of these systems used a mouse, although they were usually proprietary devices.

In around 1987, [QJUMP] launched the pointer environment, consisting of three files, PTR_GEN (a device driver for handling an on-screen cursor using either the cursor keys or a mouse), WMAN (a window manager which allows jobs to be brought to the front and stop jobs whose windows are hidden in the backgroun) and HOT_REXT (an ALTKEY hot key system where tasks and commands can be assigned to key combinations).  

This quickly became the accepted standard, particularly in conjunction with either the [QIMI] (QL Internal Mouse System), which could be added separately, or was built into some versions of the [SuperQBoard], or even a serial mouse.

The following Front Ends support the pointer interface mouse control: [QRAM], [QPAC2], [QTop], [Qascade], CueShell, [QDT] and [Launchpad].

These days, the main front end systems are [QDT] by Jim Hunkins, and [Launchpad] by Dilwyn Jones, with several people also using [Qascade] by Jonathan Hudson, all relying on the [QJUMP] pointer environment.

It is also worth checking out the collection of front end programs available from the [Sinclair QL Homepage|http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/frontend/index.html] as many former commercial titles have been released as freeware by the copyright owners.

!!OTHER PROGRAM LAUNCHERS

There are a number of simpler program launchers, such as Qascade by [Jonathan Hudson|http://www.daria.co.uk], which is a sort of start menu program which lives in the QPAC2 button frame. Other useful little utilities include Oliver Fink's Launcher (which finds all executable programs in a given directory and lets you choose one to start by listing them in a menu), Q-Starter (fairly similar to Launcher) and DEV Manager, a pointer driven launcher which lets you create lists of programs and settings so that you can have a single menu listing your favourite programs for quick and easy execution.

QL Today magazine carried a useful little review of these programs, in Volume 10 Issue 1 (June 2005) pages 48 to 52. These and other older QL front ends are widely available from PD software libraries and QL-related websites.

If you are a pointer environment user, it makes sense to use some form of front end to save having to remember old fashioned command lines to start programs. Why type repetitively when a couple of mouse clicks can do the same thing in less time and typing!

QL Gardener is a large database of garden plants, shrubs and trees, which the programs allow you to search, using up to 22 characteristics, to take account of soil type, light and the effect which you wish to obtain in your garden, in order to help you choose the right plants.

The database contains 25,000 pieces of information on more than 1,100 plant species. You can edit the database and add more entries to it if you like to enhance the database.

Simple to use this is an excellent piece of software for the home gardener.

The manual also refers to two specialist library cartridges (which are not currently preserved - does anyone have these?):
* Climbing Plants
* Rock Garden Plants

As well as the graphical representation, you can store details about each person, such as alternative spellings of names, parentage and children, details of events, such as births, deaths, marriages, baptisms and Wills. You can even link a text file or a picture with each person in the database. 

Research dates can be listed as approximate, before, after or invalid (to highlight where the dates were wrongly recorded in an original register). 

The program was designed to ensure you do not waste valuable research time in learning how to use a new program in order to enter your data.  In fact, you are asked to enter the information in pretty much the form that you find it - for example, birth certificates.  The program then tries to match up the information which you have found against the people already in your family tree, asking you to verify whether each person is a match, a possible match or definitely not a match. 

There are many other features which should meet the needs of all historians, and with a well written manual (including tutorial).

This program (including its sources) was released as freeware as part of the RWAP Software 30th Anniversary celebrations in November 2016

Chris went on to develop a Windows based program, __Genealogy Research System__ (formerly Genealogy for Windows) under the Deltadrive brand - see more details about the [Genealogy Research System|http://www.deltadrive.co.uk/].

QL Home Finance is a program designed to help you manage your finances at home.  It is not as limited as [QL Bank Account] in that not only can it list and calculate your income and outgoings, but it will also analyse and update your personal accounts as they are stored on your Sinclair QL home computer.  

The program allows you to rapidly enter payments and receipts into the system, and see all account balances as you go.  Standing Orders can be entered as a specific date of each month, the last day of each month or annually and are automatically added to (or withdrawn) from each account.

Entering data allows you to keep the date, payee/payer details, amount, reference number, type of transaction and a description.  You can edit entries afterwards and view entries in blocks of 6 items at a time.  Pressing F1 or F2 when entering a field recalls information previously typed into that field (alphabetically) which helps speed up the process of entering information.

Both single entry and double entry book keeping is supported (although single entry is limited to three accounts), with analysis by a variety of parameters, including the type of account, description of item, type of expense etc.

Unfortunately, the program does not support more than 128K memory.

QL Hopper is a fast and furious implementation of the classic arcade game, Frogger.

The aim of the game is to guide 5 frogs across the busy six lane motorway, dodging the cars and lorries, and then across the river by jumping on the sinking lily pads and logs, whilst avoiding the crocodiles, until you can get your frog into its home.

The different speeds of each obstacle makes the game more difficult to judge - highly addictive and rewarding when you do manage to get the frogs into their homes.

QL Integrated Accounts was released for the Sinclair QL by [SageSoft] and in many ways has a similar look and feel to the slightly earlier [QL Cash Trader] - which is no surprise according to a former employee of [Accounting Software Limited]%%%
((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/QL_IntegratedAccounts_2_1.jpg|QL Integrated Accounts Leaflet by Sinclair|align="r"|Leaflet for Sinclair QL QL Integrated Accounts|212|300|POPUP)) 

The program was written in C and you have to enter commands such as 
 CRUN 'mdv1_post'
to run the software following the initial Boot program.

This is a full blown accounting package, based by Sage Software's existing accounting packages for IBM PCs and ACT Apricot computers at the time, with sales and purchase ledgers, general and nominal ledgers.

This includes features which are missing from [QL Cash Trader] - mainly the ability to retain customer and supplier information, as well as the ability to enter invoices and purchase orders.  The audit trail report also reports invoice or payment details alongside each transaction making it easier to audit the accounts.

Unfortunately QL Integrated Accounts fails to cope with years post 1st January 2000. It is also not possible to change the amount of VAT, this had to be done at SageSoft with a special program to patch the code.

QL Invoicer is an easy to use menu driven program to allow you to raise invoices against a customer list, and to maintain the sales ledger for a small business.

Oddly, it is written in SuperBASIC, loaded with [QLOAD] by [Liberation Software] for speed, and as a result can easily be broken into.  The Invoicer automatically posts transactions to the sales ledger file. 

The Sales Ledger side of the program has a completely different screen layout to the rest of the program - as it is designed to be used with the other Business program suites from [SD Microsystems].

We have preserved v2.3 of the software.

QL Jabber is a different game for the Sinclair QL where you play the role of an antibody protecting the body in which you live from various bugs and diseases.  It was originally going to be called QL Jab, but Sinclair Research decided on changing the name to QL Jabber.

You are positioned in the middle of the screen and beed to move about as various bugs fly about above and below you.  You can fire darts at them to destroy them as they move (although they then turn into the wall of a cell which makes other bugs turn around).  On early levels, you are restricted to moving left and right, but on later levels, the game becomes harder, as you can move up and down too, whilst the attackers get more and more aggressive and sneaky. 

In later screens, the bugs will mutate into something else when you hit it with a dart - some turn into stars, whereas others turn into more poisonous variants of the bugs. The author was particularly proud of the little hornets which accelerate directly towards your player. You need to side step them and force them into an oscillating orbit to get them. 


The synopsis:%%%
>Welcome to the United Solar Spice Pilot Training and Disease Control Centre.  So that you will graduate familiar with all the most common bacteria and viruses before embarking upon a mission, you are to complete your final examination on the disease simulator.  You will take on the role of an antibiotic and anti-virus drug and be placed in a series of dangerous situations where you will be attacked by many different types of bacteria and virus.  Sometimes, even your own body will prove fatal to you!

wikipage: QL Macro Assembler
wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/ql_macro_assembler_package.jpg|QL Macro Assembler|align="I"|Packaging for Sinclair QL Macro Assembler by GST))%%%
QL Macro Assembler (or Q-Mac) was an update version of [QL Assembler].  Both programs were written by [GST Computer Systems] and published on the [Sinclair Research Ltd] label.

The program is a standard 68008 motorola assembler with extensive macro assembler commands (although conditional assembly can only be used inside the macros).

Again, the editor supplied is that provided with the [Metacomco Assembler]!

The assembler generates binary files from a single source (like the standard assembler) and supports INCLUDE directives (for example to make use of the standard library routines included on the microdrive).

The package also includes a separate linker to combine pre-assembled files in SROFF (Sinclair Relocatable Object File Format) format (the standard linker format, also i.e. on Atari ST) to a complete binary file.

This program has become more the standard across QLs - mainly because it was the first assembler to be able to compile the source codes for [SMSQ/e] - even today only QL Macro Assembler and the public domain [GWASS|http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/asm/index.html] assembler can compile these huge sources.

Updated versions appear in the [Quanta library|http://www.quanta.org.uk] (with bug fixes and improvements).

The latest version of the software was also released as freeware in 2012.

Unfortunately, though it was one of the first packages of that kind which generates the usual SROFF linker format, not all other companies, which lauched compilers and assemblers go straight ahead with this format, instead uses their own ways, making it somewhat hard for the programmer to combine code from different compilers and assemblers.

QL Mail List was published by [Transform] and written to work with the Archive Run Time Package ([ArchDEV/ArchRTM]).

The program allows you to maintain sets of either personal or business contacts, and then to process a mailshot, using a letter created in [Quill] and merging it with the contacts database.

Merge fields were entered as the field number preceded by ampersand - for example: %%%
&1 %%%
in the Quill document (meaning field 1)

You could merge several fields in one line using the - character, for example: %%%
&1-4 
would return fields 1,2,3 and 4 on one line.

It was also necessary to leave at least one space after the field name.

The program is fairly easy to use - we have preserved v3.00 of the software (and amended the Boot file to cope with post Year 2000 dates).

QL Meteor Storm is based on the classic arcade game "Asteroids".  In this game, you are sent by The United Solar Spice, Mining and Space Pilot Training Academy on a short test mission in the meteor belt.

You find yourself in charge of a small space ship in the middle of an asteroid field - as the asteroids come towards you, you need to shoot at them, breaking them into several smaller pieces.  Eventually, the pieces are small enough to be destroyed by your blaster, but be careful, if one of them hits your ship, you will be killed.  The asteroids do not rotate unfortunately, due to the pressure placed on the authors by Sinclair Research to release the game.

There are also alien spaceships flying about and space mines in amongst the asteroid belt, so another hazard to avoid.

The speed of your space ship is also influenced by the asteroids belt, and inhibitor circuits prevent you from moving quickly when you are surrounded by many large meteors.

Interesting to REMark: The BOOT program of this software was protected with the SPK (Sinclair Production Kit) via FLOAD but the main program mstorm_cde was easily executed with LYBYTES and CALL.

QL Paint is a bitmap drawing program produced by [Talent Computer Systems] which was based on their program, [GraphiQL], except that rather than being controlled wholly by the keyboard, QL Paint, could be controlled by a set of icons (this was later releeased under Talent's own label as GraphiQL+).

Quite a neat utility, this provides the most common commands you require and handles both 4 and 8 colour screen modes, allowing you to access the full 512x256 screen.  Files are output as full 32768 byte screen dumps.  This is one of the few drawing programs which allows you to set the flash attribute on each pixel, and includes the following features:

*Freehand drawing, 8 colours, optional flash
*Rubber banding, rubber boxes, circles and elipses
*Variable size texture definition
*Doodle pad
*Colour and texture fill of any shaped area
*User definable paint brush - any colour or width
*Colour list for full colour control
*Re-colour facilitiy
*Magnification with panning
*Mirroring and rotation of parts of the screen
*Air-brush effect
*On-line help facility

wikipage: QL Pawn
wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/pawn_package.jpg|QL Pawn|align="I"|Packaging for Sinclair QL Pawn Adventure))%%%
QL Pawn is probably the most famous adventure written for the machine.  It was first talked about in QLUB News (published by [Sinclair Research Ltd] in September 1985, said to be coming soon.

QL Pawn is a highly interactive game (one of the first instances of true interactive fiction), where you are placed as the star of a narrative story, in which the characters all have independent ideas about how to behave. The precept of the text adventure is fairly simple - you wake up on a strange island wearing a silver wristband.  As you explore the island, you meet a variety of characters, the majority of whom ask you to complete a small task for them.

The Pawn is unfortunately the only [Magnetic Scrolls] adventure which was published for the Sinclair QL - it was supplied originally on two microdrive cartridges, and included a new operating system, which enabled the feature packed interpreter to allow you to really interact with characters. 

The QL version is v1.0 of the game and does only run on systems, which emulates the complete hardware of QL.

Later versions were released for the Atari ST, Commodore Amiga and C64, Apple 2, Archimedes and Sinclair ZX Spectrum (amongst others). Magnetic Scrolls used to use a self written cut-down 68k OS emulator to run their games on non-68k hardware. 

[The Prawn] spoof of this adventure was created by [Martin Hopkins]

wikipage: QL Payroll
wikitext: A version of QL Payroll was released in 1985 by [TR Computer Systems] which promised similar facilities to the program later published by [PDQL].  

QL Payroll is a menu driven, simple to use payroll program for up to 99 employees (handling both weekly and monthly paid employees, SSP, deductions, national insurance, tax and pension contributions). 

The program allows you to calculate NIC and Tax automatically - simply enter the details of your business and each employee as they join your business. Change the tax details each tax year and then enter details of hours worked per week or per month to run off the payroll.   Deductions can be varied temporarily in any pay period and you can stop payments or pay back deductions during holiday periods.

The program will also generate P35, P40 and P60 forms as well as running totals of all NIC and Tax deducted, although it does need work to bring it up to current standards.

The history of this program is uncertain.

The version from TR Computer Systems was limited to only 75 employees and was written by Bob Griffith in SuperBASIC (spread across several programs which load as you use the main program).  It appears to have later been re-written in BCPL in order to speed up the program and provide some protection for the source files.

An updated version was then released as PDQ-Payroll by PDQL, which we know was written by [Chas Dillon] and compiled with Turbo.  The source for PDQ-Payroll bears quite a lot of similarity to the source for the version from TR Computer Systems and it would therefore appear that the PDQL version was based on the original version from TR Computer Systems.

Eventually, the rights to market the software transferred to [Digital Precision Ltd], although the software was still supported by Chas Dillon.  Following the withdrawal of Digital Precision from the QL market, Chas agreed to release the source code for QL Payroll as public domain, subject to no-one else making a profit from his sources.

[RWAP Software] then took on the mantle of this software, making changes to get around the millenium bug and correcting a few minor errors and making a few minor improvements.  [RWAP Software] then sold this enhanced version for a nominal amount, to cover the costs of continuing to support the software to mainly existing users.

This version was then released as public domain as part of the RWAP Software's 30th Anniversary celebrations in 2016 - again, subject to the proviso stated by Chas Dillon, that no-one else is allowed to make a profit from the sources.

wikipage: QL Plus CP/M Interface
wikitext: The CP/M Interface by QL Plus Limited (an offshoot of [PCML Ltd]) was mentioned in the news section of QL User (December 1984/January 1985 issue) and a working prototype, designed by Robert Harvey, was said to have been demonstrated at the Compec Show at Olympia in November 1984.

This was described as an extension card containing a Z80 processor and 64K RAM which would sell at £199.

The statement by John Fuller (MD of QL Plus Limited) states that the 4MHz Z80 runs in parallel with the QL's 68008 processor, with the latter being used for fast I/O operations.  The board features two ports which would be configured in software as a mouse controller and a parallel printer interface, although the company intended to release alternative software to allow them to be used as a disk controller and robotics controller.

The disk controller was designed as a piggy-back board attached to the original interface.

The news item cites [Tony Tebby] as having partly engineered the link between the Z80 and the QL, and W H Smith were also said to be busy converting CP/M software onto microdrive for use with the unit.

It is sadly unknown whether this interface was ever released, although more details appear in the profile of QL Plus in QL User (March 1985) and the advert by PCML in the April 1985 issue stated:%%%
>"Our New CMP 3.0 Z-80 Card will be available in June"

In an early letter from Sinclair Research (undated), listing programs available for the Sinclair QL, mention is made of CPM/80 from PCML.

- Unique - the prediction formulae calculate the efficiency of every team with present and past results.%%%

Advertised features by December 1985 included:
- Database upgraded to include 25,000 matches over 12 years
- Ease: Rather than having to tpye in each team name, which can be up to 16 characters long, you simply type in up to 3 figures and the teams are displayed on your screen

Advertised features for v3.3 (Feb 1989) included the following additional comments:

- Improved massive database - complete with all matches played since 1960%%%
- Forecasts score draws and no score draws with built-in perm generator%%%
- Mark your coupon direct from screen / printer%%%
- Successful - we guarantee that Poolswinner performs considerably better than chance.  If you can prove otherwise we shall reimburse you.

QL Quill is designed to provide an in-depth guide to the Psion word-processor program [Quill] which was bundled with the Sinclair QL home computer from launch and was one of the first word-processors to be entirely controlled by menus.

The book is an excellent, straightforward guide which covers each function with detailed, practical examples and sample exercises, aimed squarely at the beginner.

The book concerns the lives and loves of Nigel Wooten and Miranda Blake, as they try to come to grips with the business of getting married, and exercises are built around this, from composing a letter asking for Miranda's parents' blessing to the marriage.

Illustrations throughout are by the Sunday Times cartoonist, Derek Adler.

The book forms part of the Blueprint series of books, which provided an excellent reference guide to the Psion suite of programs supplied with the Sinclair QL.

QL Reversi was one of the first games released for the Sinclair QL and was included by Sinclair in its advertising leaflets for the QL (as can be seen from the leaflets on this page).

QL Reversi is an implementation of Othello (otherwise known as Reversi), where you place tiles on a board which is based on a grid.  The tiles are black on one side and white on the other - you play one colour. %%% 

To place your tile on the board, you need to "capture" at least one tile of the opposing colour, by placing one of your own tiles either side of your opponents pieces in a straight line.  The winner is the one with the most tiles of their colour on the board at the end of the game.

The computer plays a strong game and is hard to beat.  You can also watch a demonstration game (computer plays itself) or play a second human player.  Further options enable you to change the start-up position and decide whether you play black (the first to move) or white.

This version includes quite a nice animation as the tiles are placed on the Board, and also when the tiles are flipped over (captured) to change colour.

wikipage: QL S.U.B.
wikitext: QL Super User Bureau was an ambitious project to provide professional support for the QL family of computers in the late 1980s. They took subscriptions on the basis of producing 12 monthly magazines a year. 

In reality they only got 4 issues out altogether. Thus they were unable to collect subs in their 2nd year and presumably their only income came from sales of 3rd party products which wasn't enough to keep them going. All the while they were committed to providing support to members which must have drained their resources when they were under pressure to produce a 40 page magazine every month. In the end despite taking colourful full page adverts in QL world and gaining around 700 members they simply ran out of cash. 

To imply that one can provide answers to every query that occurs across all possible software and hardware configurations was already a tough ask. That in itself would have justified a £15 sub. But the promise of a large mag every month was the killer. If they had said that the sub included a 'regular' publication then they could have got away with say a quarterly mag of 24 pages, not too onerous. They were nice people but perhaps somewhat naïve. Boss Richard Turner knew his QL stuff and was a good writer but he couldn't hope to cope with such an ambitious project and work load.

Even if they had got their business plan right it's doubtful it could have lasted more than a few years. The QL market simply wasn't big enough.

wikitext: Released in 1986, The QL Small Traders Pack consisted of no less than 10 programs designed to assist management of any small business on a single mdv cartridge and priced at a remarkable £19.95. 

The modules included sales and purchase ledgers, mailing list, stock control, phone directory, billboard display, cartridge clone and others. 

Advertised in the back of Sinclair QL World, the package won a loyal band of users who wanted to employ the QL in business without too much cost and complexity. SD Microsystems went on to release a version 2 of QL Small Trader priced @ £24.95 on 2 mdvs and an add on package, [QL Invoicer], for those traders who needed to produce invoices and statements. 

The Invoicer automatically posted transactions to the sales ledger file. 

The series was rounded off with [QL Stock Accounting] for expanded machines which increased the level of integration by linking the invoicer with the stock file as well as the sales ledger.

SD Microsystems also produced [General Ledger] to handle cash and bank transactions and print reports such as Trading and Profit v Loss. Some of their software received mostly positive reviews in QL World, QL S.U.B. and QL Technical Review.

wikipage: QL Stock Accounting
wikitext: QL Stock Accounting is a powerful business package which integrated a 999 item stock inventory file with sales ledger and invoicing. It forms a companion program to the [QL Small Traders Pack] and [General Ledger].

Stock descriptions and prices can be called up from the invoicer with their levels being automatically adjusted and a posting made to the customer's account in the sales ledger. 

A wide range of reports such as stock re-ordering, valuation, debtors list, statements etc can also be produced. QL Stock Accounting was designed to run on expanded QLs.

wikipage: QL Super Monitor
wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/supermonitor_package.jpg|Digital Precision QL Super Monitor Package|align="i"|Sinclair QL Super Monitor by Digital Precision))%%%

QL Super Monitor is a 68000 machine code monitor and disassembler.  Interestingly, when first launched in the April 1985 issue of QL User, this was advertised as release 2.0 (no idea what happened to v1.0) and was listed as including "a full 68000 Disassembler program, supplied free to purchasers of the QL Super Monitor".  We have never seen this disassembler program.

It supports the usual commands which you would expect, including trace, disassemble, edit an error of memory, set break points, load files into memory and display / change registers.

It is not as complete as [QMON] and lacks some of the facilities in that package (such as being able to easily monitor executable tasks, and edit machine code as assembler codes).

Advertised features included:
*Free full 68000 Standard disassembler 100% integrated with the monitor - the combination occupies less than 8.5K
*Edit/Jump/Trace/Set/Execute/Catalogue/Dump/Load/Save
*Display and Set Registers
*Debug/Disassemble
*Hex and Modulo Arithmetic
*List/Set and Cancel Breakpoints
*Single Step
*Page in and Out of SuperBASIC
*Backup/Copy
*Base to any base number conversion
*Trace RAM and ROM
*Alter and Display memory
*Instructions provided as Quill file

We have preserved v2.0 of the software (although there was a v3.0 released in November 1985 if anyone has a copy of this).

QL SuperBASIC (The Definitive Handbook) is an in-depth guide to programming the Sinclair QL home computer in SuperBASIC, written by the designer and author of Sinclair's QL SuperBASIC language.

It looks at SuperBASIC from every aspect, including an in-depth description of the parser and how arrays work, including graphics, sound, Procedures and functions and anything else you may wish to know about the inner workings of SuperBASIC.

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/books/quanta-SuperBASIC Handbook.jpg|QL SuperBASIC (The Definitive Handbook)|align="r"|QL SuperBASIC (The Definitive Handbook) by Jan Jones))%%%
The book was so successful, that the Sinclair QL user group, [QUANTA] later arranged at some cost, to have a second print of the book made - all copies were sold relatively quickly. Quanta obtained special permission for this print run from Jan Jones, who now owns the copyright to the material.  

In 2014 (the QL's 30th anniversary year), Jan Jones re-typed and re-edited this book for use with e-readers - and it is available from [Amazon|http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00P569EH4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B00P569EH4&linkCode=as2&tag=sellmcom-21&linkId=ZS4NLRAINLNYHTJV|en|Buy eBook version of QL SuperBASIC (The Definitive Handbook)]

The QL Technical Guide was the official Sinclair Research Limited publication which set out details on how to write machine code software for the Sinclair QL to meet the Sinclair standards and interface to the QL's operating system, QDOS.

This sets out everything that a machine code programmer should know, including the memory map, exception processing, launching jobs, creating new procedures and functions for SuperBASIC, adding operating system extensions, device drivers, peripheral cards and the TRAPs and Vector calls necessary to interface to QDOS.

Sections are also included on doing business with Sinclair and how to get Sinclair to distribute your products as part of their catalogue.

The QL Technical Manual included information not published in other publications about QDOS, such as how to directly access the microdrive sectors in machine code (rather than using QDOS) and how the slave blocks work.  This book was much sought after by QL enthusiasts, and was only later superceded by the enhanced [QDOS and SMS Reference Manual].

For many years both an English and a German version of the magazine were published. Unfortunately, QL Today closed its pages in 2013 with the release a final issue and a large DVD full of information, videos and software for the QL.

It was always well respected and featured regular advertising from all of the major QL hardware and software suppliers during the period.  There were lots of interesting articles from famous QLers (although some people did complain that at times, they were too indepth for new users), and regular series about programming in SuperBASIC and assembler.

Following one slip of the pen, it was affectionately known as 'QL Toady'

QL Touch 'n' Go is a typing tutor to get you used to touch typing on the Sinclair QL's keyboard, with exercises which can help you achieve 30 words per minute with 95% accuracy.

There are a series of tests which you can use to improve your skills (62 lessons in all).  The tests are based on the ''Harcourt Keyboard Mastery Method'' which was designed by Stan Harcourt, who had taught typing for years using traditional methods based on 'hieroglyphic' drills.  The Harcourt Keyboard Mastery Method was based on the early introduction of the most frequently used letters and the 1,000 most commonly used.

Oddly the initial screen says that the program is (c) 1985 Caxton Software Limited, although everywhere else, Harcourt Systems is mentioned with copyright dates of 1983 and 1984, so it is unclear as to the history of this software, although it appears that this was originally developed for disc based computers before the QL.  The tutorial program is marked (c) S.V. Harcourt.

wikitext: QL Trackball is a fairly standard version of a trackball (also called the Command Control), produced by Wico Corporation and initially aimed at Atari home video games, then making it onto Commodore Vic-20,Apple II and TRS-80 home computers.

A trackball is almost like an upside down mouse, where you move the ball around with your fingers in order to control the joystick or cursor on screen.

This appears to have only been released in the US market - it has a standard Atari style joystick connector (OK for US and European QLs), but which would need a joystick convertor on the UK standard QL.

The unit is also powered with a 6V power supply.

QL Wanderer was a trading game for the Sinclair QL produced by the French software house [Pyramide] where you travel from planet to planet trying to collect five Aces, or 8,000 cats (the monetary unit in this system) in order to reach the all-powerful Sphinx which has kidnapped your Landlady's cat and taken it to the centre of the Galaxy.  

The the game includes some novel concepts, including the fact that the graphics are drawn in Anaglyph 3D, requiring you to wear the blue and red lensed glasses; and the merger of a trading game, and an adventure with a poker-type card game.

According to the Sinclair QL Profile feature on Pyramide (October 1986) Pyramide had entered discussions with Sinclair Research regarding the possibility of bundling QL Wanderer with the QL as an outstanding representative of the QL handling of fast graphics, with initial order quantities to be around 10,000 units and if the early discussions in October 1985 had proved fruitul, it would have been placed in Dixon's QL package.

Unfortunately for Pyramide, this project was abandoned by Sinclair as other priorities developed.

The Keyboard-90 plugged into the Sinclair QL via the socket for the 8049 co-processor and worked with either the original 8049 chip, or the [Hermes] replacement co-processor.

The interface allowed an XT or AT-style keyboard to be connected to the QL via a flying lead. 

The board also contained an 8039, four 74-series logic and five 4000-series logic ICs.

An external version of the interface was also produced, whereby it connected to the 8049 co-processor socket via a flat ribbon cable, with the interface then placed within a plastic case which would sit outside the QL.

Although these interfaces proved quite popular, the use of wire pins for the connection to the 8049 socket meant that the pins were easily bent or broken.

QL-Switch limits the memory for each program to 128K and allowed you to run up to 4 copies of the Psion programs simultaneously (each program requiring 128K, so you needed 512K available memory to run all 4). 

QL-Switch added a new SuperBASIC command, MULTI which allowed you to load several programs at a time, such as

>10 MULTI "flp1_ABACUS", "flp1_QUILL"

Oddly QUILL had to be the last program in the list.

Once loaded, you could move between the programs by pressing ALT F1, ALT F2, ALT F3 and ALT F4.

The other programs are suspended in the background whilst the current program runs.

((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/qlswitch-psientific-package.jpg|QL Switch for Sinclair QL|align="I"|Packaging for Sinclair QL Switch by Psientific Software))%%%

QL-Switch as released by Psientific Software would appear to be similar in functionality to the above version.

This version of the program works with any executable program, not just the Psion programs.

It adds a SuperBASIC keyword ''SWITCH'' which lists the programs available and their turn on keys - which can be CTRL+F1 to CTRL+F5, CTRL+A to CTRL+Z and ALT+F1 to ALT+F5.

When setting up the programs, you can also set an amount of job space for each task, as well as the heap space; and add a prompt to be displayed on screen when a task is launched (for example to prompt you to insert a different microdrive cartridge).

The other programs are suspended in the background whilst the current program runs and this version of QL-Switch even adds facilities to auto-launch programs by POKE_W 163978,245 (for example) and even pass defined strings to the console when a task is launched (for example to load a specific document into Quill).

wikipage: QL2K
wikitext: QL2K is a freeware emulator written by Jimmy Montesinos and Raphael Zhou for Microsoft Windows 2000/XP/2003 and was based on the [QLAY] emulator by Jan Venema.  It  first appeared at the QL US Show 2003 with the kindness of Phoebus Dokos.

QL2K is aimed at new Windows machines such as Windows 2000 or Windows XP and  has been successfully tested on Windows Millenium. QL2K is not a simple port, it provides extra features, including DirectX support and it tries to give a following to the Jan Venema development. 

In the same spirit, although it is free of charge, registration is needed to build a community of users in order to promote further development by other people.and allow people to communicate about issues they find and help the development of the product.

QL2K is still in an early alpha version and debugging is in progress. Corrections are made as quickly as possible, and the latest alpha support English, French, Spanish, German, Italian and Greek.

The latest version has a new User Interface and gives the ability to configure these several settings :
-Memory size ( 128 K, 256K, 384K, 512K, 640K, 896K ) as well as : ( 1M, 2M, 4M and 8M )%%%
-Screen size : 512x256, 512x341, 768x512, 1024x683, 1024x768, 1280x640, 1280x1024%%%
-Keyboard country (US, UK, FR, GE, IT)%%%
-Speed and Delay%%%
-Main ROM and 6 secondary expansion ROM.%%%
-Use of mouse.%%%
-ALT Key  -  the QL ALT is reassigned to the ALT-GR on the PC keyboard, as the PC ALT key is needed by Windows and the QL2K menu system.%%%
-Support for microdrives images (from MDV1_ to MDV8_) and WIN drives ( QLAY NFA ) (from WIN1_ to WIN8_)%%%
-DirectX ( DirectDraw ).

QMON is a 68000 machine code monitor and disassembler.  It was originally released on the Sinclair label as [QL Monitor].

It supports the usual commands which you would expect, including trace, disassemble, edit an error of memory, set break points and display / change registers.  You can also edit the assembly language listing directly (rather than having to work in opcodes!), as well as calculate numbers in binary, decimal, octal and hexadecimal.

An excellent search function also allows you to search for bytes in memory, assembler language instructions or strings.  You can also specify whether it should trace user level code only, or also supervisor level code.

The QMON SuperBASIC command can also be used to launch an executable task, with QMON starting to monitor it from the address loaded in memory.

Its various utilities replace those which appeared in the earlier [QRAM].

QPAC2 includes the Pointer Environment and adds the following utilities which are all accessed from the QPAC2 button frame (normally a bar across the top of the screen with various buttons in it to start programs):

* Sysdef - This allows you to set printer and mouse settings, plus alter the default data and program default directories, as well the destination device.%%%
* Things Menu - (This can be a little hard to understand as a 'Thing' is a bit of code in memory which can be called using a standard calling block - it can be a device driver, a program, or a pop-up menu) - This menu allows you examine what is using each thing and the resources that thing is using (such as channels); you can also execute a thing or Wake it.%%%
* Jobs Menu - This allows you to examine jobs (channels and things used by the Job, memory usage), pick a job, remove a job and alter the job's priority%%%
* Hotkeys Menu - This allows you to view all defined hotkeys and execute the hotkey directly.%%%
* Channels Menu - This allows you to view all channels open on the sytem and find out what is using them - you can also close the channels directly or remove any Job which owns the channel%%%
* Files Menu - This is perhaps the most powerful menu, allowing you to get directories of devices (and sub-directories), copy, move, rename or delete files, view or print files, or execute them.  When executing files, you can specify whether they are to be unlocked (can overwrite anything else on screen), need a guardian window (to ensure that all of the screen used by the program is cleared and protected when switching between jobs), or if it is a Psion program (ie. needs to be prevented from grabbing all of the QL's available memory).  File lists can be sorted using a number of options, and you can view file statistics for each file.%%%

QPAC2 also installs a RAM disk and printer spooler, plus the ability to make an image of a microdrive cartridge (by using FORMAT ram1_mdv1 for example).

After Tony Tebby left the QL scene it was further developed and updated for current SMSQ/E systems by [Marcel Kilgus]. 

QPAC2 has been released as freeware in early 2014.

wikipage: QPC2
wikitext: [QPC II|QPC2]  originated as an emulator for the [Sinclair QL] home computer, but is now the leading platform to run [SMSQ/E], the successor of the Sinclair [QDOS] operating system. This emulator is written by [Marcel Kilgus] and it is the easier platform to use [SMSQ/E] if you already own an PC compatible computer.

[Tony Tebby], the original [QDOS] developer, did write a successor to the original [QDOS] system called [SMSQ/E]. While the first very early test versions of [QPC] were based on [QDOS] all official releases are based on [SMSQ/E] and profit hugely of its features like:
-Highly efficient pre-emptive multitasking%%%
-The popular SBasic programming language%%%
-Higher screen resolution (up to 4096x4096 is supported)%%%
-High colour (16 bit = 65536 colour) support%%%
-Pointer environment windowing system%%%
-Hotkey system%%%
-Toolkit II built in%%%
-Hard disc access (using a virtual hard disc file)%%%
-Floppy disc access (QDOS, TOS and MS-DOS format)%%%
-8 serial ports with up to 115200 baud%%%
-4 printer ports%%%

[QPC] does not use any [SMSQ/E] version for native hardware, instead [Marcel Kilgus] have adapted [SMSQ/E] (including all drivers) to [QPC]'s needs so that both can work together as smoothly as possible.

Furthermore there are some features Marcel specifically added for [QPC] like:
-Access to native PC drives ("DOS device")%%%
-Synchronization of Windows clipboard and Scrap extension%%%
-Control of audio CDs%%%
-Support for the SMSQ/E sampled sound system.%%%
-The emulation used is highly optimized and thus very fast. [QPC1|QPC] for example is written in 100% assembler code! This version, however, suffers under some limitations of compatibility. It cannot run directly under Windows 95, Windows NT, OS/2 or whatever. It requires a special DOS environment to work properly. 

The situation has changed with the release of [QPC2]. This is a native Win32 application that runs happily under Windows 9x, ME, NT, 2000, XP and Windows 10.

Thanks to Marcel's innovative [QPCPrint|https://www.kilgus.net/qpcprint/] you can capture the printer output from QPC2 and easily print it from any connected Windows printer.

wikitext: QPEDE is a variation on the original arcade game, centipede, written by [Elaborate Bytes] for the Sinclair QL.

In this game, you are shooting at a giant centipede that is weaving its way down the screen through various obstacles to eat you.  You can destroy some of the obstacles to clear the way for your gun, but if you hit the centipede, that segment of its body will turn into a solid obstacle again.  Hit the centipede anywhere but at its head or its tail, and you will slice it into two, increasing the number of centipedes you have to deal with.

There is also a rather nasty oversized spider that bounces across the bottom of the screen and will also kill you if it hits you.

wikipage: QSPELL
wikitext: There appears to have been two programs for the Sinclair QL called QSPELL, one by [Eidersoft] and a second by [Quantum Mechanics].  It is of course possible that Eidersoft merely published the program developed by Quantum Mechanics.

!!!Eidersoft version of QSPELL

QSPELL is a spelling checker for Quill, with a 25,000 word dictionary which can auto-learn words and be used to solve crosswords, anagrams and puzzles.

Alas, the downside of QSpell was that it is not interactive - it can only check a finished Quill document, rather than checking as you type.

You could however, integrate QSpell with Psion's [Quill] in that by pressing CTRL F3, within Quill, you brought up a QSpell menu bar, which allowed you to load an edit file which has been created by the main QSpell program - this then shows the original Quill file, with mistakes highlighted in reverse capitals.
You can then use the Find function to move to the next mistake.

It had a useful crossword search, which allows you to match words using wildcards, such as "m?ga??ne" or "maga*", plus an anagram and puzzle search.  The puzzle search lists all words which can be made from the letters of another word.

wikipage: QTalk
wikitext: Maxtronics R&D Ltd of New Zealand produced the QTalk speech synthesiser for the QL. It connected to an RS232 port on the QL, the QL power supply connected to the QTalk unit and a short power lead went from the unit to the QL itself. It came with text to speech software and had a device driver called "QTK" which allowed easy programming by means of OPEN and PRINT# commands. 

The unit had three adjustable presets, allowing adjustment of volume, pitch and pitch range. The software featured text to speech conversion, over 400 rules to convert text to speech, with an "exception table" for words which the unit could not be expected to understand.

Maxtronics claimed it could be "the last word in QL clocks" as it could talk the time an date!

Maxtronics also sold some games for it, written by [Chisoft] including [Alien Hijack] and [Puzzle Mania] which made good use of the speech synthesiser.

wikipage: QTop
wikitext: A desktop suite written in 1988 by [Urs Koenig] of Switzerland. Marketed and maintained between 1989 and 1995 by [COWO Electronic] with initial distributors [TK Computerware] in the UK and [QLympic Computer Systems] in Germany. Later on [Software 87] and [Dilwyn Jones Computing](DJC) acted as resellers.

Initially conceived as [Thor-Desk] for the powerful CST Thor XVI launched in September 1987, the intention was to bundle it with every shipped Thor computer. In 1989 it became clear that the Thor story would end, so the decision was made to expand the design in a way (by adding Thor XVI emulators for each platform) that it would run on all other QDOS compatible computers from the original SINCLAIR QL with 128KB RAM and Microdrives to the ATARI ST with QL-Emulator. The QTop suite also runs on the COMMODORE AMIGA with QL emulation without any restrictions, which is more than what can be said of most other QL software. The more expanded a QL system is, the better QTop performs.

In January 1998 Urs Koenig declared QTop and other [COWO Electronic] software packages as freeware. The software was then submitted as is to Gerhard Plavec for inclusion on the QL-PD/CD-R which was the first in the series of QL related [CD-ROMs]. In January 2002 and updated edition named QTop/E was announced for the upcoming QL software distribution called QL/E. The latest version can be found on The Distribution, see [DVDs].

It was formed in February 1984 (under the name IQLUG - Independent QL User's Group)  with the aim of providing an independent source of support for, and sharing information about, the Sinclair QL. In time, it has expanded its brief to include compatible systems such as the ICL OPD (One Per Desk), CST Thor, Aurora and Q40/Q60, as well as emulators of the Sinclair QL running on other platforms. 

QUANTA is a non-profit organisation run by an elected committee of honorary officials. 

Membership is by subscription, which includes a bi-monthly magazine, access to QUANTA's large free QL software library, advice and help with QL-related matters and support for local sub-groups. QUANTA also run a workshop once a year which is open to anyone interested in the Sinclair QL.

QUANTA have been instrumental in bringing updated versions of several items to the market:

*[Super Gold Card]
*[QL SuperBASIC (The Definitive Handbook)]
*[Assembler Workbench]
*[QL Macro Assembler]
*[QLEA ROM Switcher]
*[QIMI]

They have also helped fund various hardware projects over the years, including new batches of replacement keyboard membranes.

Quantum Theory is aimed at the first time user and explains how the QL computer works, and what you can do with it.  It boasts that it is the first book to based on a working machine, rather than (as many of the early QL books did) being based on the promotional information and draft manuals issued by Sinclair Research Limited before the machines were actually available.

It provides a useful introduction to actually programming the Sinclair QL in SuperBASIC, as well as the machine itself, covering topics such as sound, turtle graphics, advanced graphics, arithmetic and file handling.

Quazimodo is a good implementation of the original arcade game, whereby you play the part of Quazimodo, as he races across the castle ramparts pulling bells to reach his beloved Esmerelda who has been locked up in a tower.  

As you try to get across the ramparts, you are chased by a knight, and have to avoid pits, other knights and swing on ropes.

Written in partial SuperBASIC and machine code handling for the graphics, this is a colourful representation of the game - unfortunately, there are only 15 screens.

Version 1.53 ROM added the facility to read 'alien' disk cartridges such as on Syquest removable media.

The version 2 ROM (which needed GAL1 and GAL2 chip updates as well) added a Trashcan facility and the ability to connect Atapi IDE devices such as the Iomega ZIP drives.

Various versions of the ROM and the support utilities are available for download from [the Sinclair QL Homepage|http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/qlrom/index.html]

In 2013, José Leandro from Spain, re-designed the QubIDE PCB from the original schematics and also included a 512kB extension on it. Ready-made batches were shipped in January 2015. This is an extension card with no through connector. The software is based on the v1.56A firmware.

*[OScard] - Add-on to provide memory switch and RAM capacity for [CP/M 68K Operating System]
*[QL Expansion Console] - A four way expansion bus

They also sold an early 5.25" disk drive systems (1985) which offered a single 200K drive for £249, or an 800K dual disk drive for £800.

The news section of QL User (December 1984/January 1985 issue) states that Quest had exhibited a 'staggering 2 Gigabyte laser disk for the QL' - laser disks were the forerunners of CDs and this would have been an amazing technological revolution at the time.  However, the price of 'less than £30,000' may have been a little off-putting for ordinary Sinclair QL users!

wikipage: Quest Floppy Disk Drive
wikitext: The Quest Floppy Disk Drive was an early floppy disk drive interface plus disk drive system from [Quest Automation Ltd]).

The disk interface was large (270 x 30 x 120mm), supplied in a matt black metal casing, resting on two plastic feet, and could handle 3", 3 1/2", 5 1/4" and 8" floppy disk drives

The interface actually allowed for you to add on an O/S card, which was required if you wished to run the [CP/M 68K Operating System].

Quest also offered their own disk drives to go with the interface - which were housed in high quality ribbed black plastic moulded cabinets (with the dual 5 1/4" drives measuring 410x190x140mm), providing room for a fan inside the housing.

As with the [Micro Peripherals Floppy Disk Interface], the Quest interface did not conform to the [QJump] "FLP" system used by most companies at the time (it used the name FDV to access the disk drives).  It also lacked direct sector access and had no built in extra commands other than FORMAT.

The implement of FORMAT was also non-standard, as it was:

FORMAT number_type_name

allowing you to specify the type of format (80 tracks double sided, 40 tracks single sided or double sided for example).

There was also a formatting command (QFORM) which was supplied on microdrive cartridge, along with the floppy disk driver (which does at least mean that you could patch the driver to use FLP).

Prices were:
*O/S Card: £49.50
*Single 180K 5.25" Disk Drive £295
*Dual 180K 5.25" Disk Drive £469
*Single 360K 5.25" Disk Drive £419

wikipage: Quest Memory Expansion
wikitext: The Quest Memory Expansion was an early range of rather large memory expansion cards from a company called Quest International Computer Technology Ltd. (otherwise known as [Quest Automation Ltd]).

The company released various versions, 64K, 128K, 256K and 512K extra memory.  However, these were the slowest memory expansion units ever made for the QL, based on 4164 RAM chips, running at the same speed as internal RAM - less than one megabyte per second - despite the lack of contention from video access. 

This made them half the speed of the fastest 8-bit expansions, such as the [CST RAM-Plus], the early [SuperQBoard] and later [Trump Card].

Prices were :%%%
*64K RAM: £115
*128K RAM: £185
*256K RAM: £349
*512K RAM: £579

The boards measured 247mm x 97mm and were supplied in a large plastic casing.  The 512K unit also required a separate power supply.

A ram disk was also provided with the memory interfaces, although this was supplied on separate microdrive cartridge.

wikipage: Quill
wikitext: Quill is the first wordprocessor package written by [Psion] and packaged with the Sinclair QL home computer.  The US version of the software is simply called 'Word Processor'

Quill uses the same friendly menu driven interface familiar to users of the other Psion business programs, [Abacus], [Archive] and [Easel] and you could import data between all four programs.

Written at the time when dot matrix printers were just beginning to emerge, Quill only offers a limited range of fonts and styles, although more could be added through the printer translates program.  As a result, its output now looks dated compared to modern word processors, although it still remains very popular, due to its simplicity and ease of use.

Quill was developed originally on a VAX mainframe in 1983 in C by Martin Stamp. Tested on some of the in-house 'rack-based' development versions of the QL, the software had to be reduced in size using a 'table-language' developed by Psion, in order to ensure that the programs could fit within the QL's memory and microdrive cartridges.

In common with the other Psion business programs, the main problem with Quill was that it grabs all of the QL's available memory, thus making it difficult to multi-task with the other programs (even on expanded systems).  This was resolved by programs such as [CHOice] and [QL Switch].

Quill was also included as part of the [Xchange] package.

Work on the four Psion office packages Quill, [Archive], [Abacus] and [Easel] started about 18 months prior to the QL's launch in January 1984.  Originally developed on a VAX minicomputer, discussions began between Psion and Sinclair Research about developing it for the QL.  The software was therefore developed in a way which allowed it to be ported to various machines and processors (eventually it was released for the Sinclair QL, the IBM PC, Graduate, ICL One Per Desk, Merline Tonto, Apricot and Sirius computers).

Coding actually commenced in April 1983 and in late summer 1983, Psion were given a rack-based development QL to begin the work of testing - although Psion had to use their own 'table-language' to reduce the size of the code in order to get it to fit on a standard QL's 90K RAM.

It was this table-language which led to a lot of criticism over the original v1 Psion programs, which had to be loaded in parts from microdrive during use.

v2.00 of the software was released in March 1985, which was programmed in native 68000 machine code, providing a much needed speed boost and leaving more room in memory.

Some further improvements were added to Quill by third parties, such as [TurboQuill] to enhance its speed, and [Spellbound] and [Qtyp] spellcheckers.

wikipage: Quilmerg
wikitext: Quilmerg is a mail-merge program, designed to merge database fields stored in an [Archive] file into a document created by the word processor [Quill]. 

The program handles documents about three pages long and with up to 15 different fields. Each field is restricted 
to a maximum of 25 characters. 

Before Quilmerg is used two separate files must be produced, one of which contains the selected records from Archive. Once the required records have been selected they are written to a file using the Export command. The second file contains the document, created using the Print command in Quill to output to a file. Merge fields are entered by surrounding the name of the field by < and >.

wikipage: QVME Card
wikitext: A QL emulator for Atari STe and other Ataris with VME card slots (also known as Mega STE or TT and also MegaST with VME BUS adaptor). From [Jochen Merz] Software. 

Supports all three serial ports on the Mega STE, with split baudrates and buffering on all three. All support baudrates up to 19,200 and the third one also supports 38,400 and 57,600 baud. Capable of resolutions up to 1280x900. No soldering required. See also [STQL Emulator] card.

Unfortunately, QVME just supports the MODE 4 colour scheme, as there was no GD2 in 1992.

The QVME card was designed by Edwin Holtmann. Jochen Merz also supplied a disk free of charge to use the QVME card with a fix high screen size under native Atari in two colour mode (b/w). This gave some Atari programs (e.g. Calamus) more ease of use. Well written Atari programs had no problems with this screen size, as the driver writes a "Cookie" (a kind of system variable in TOS). With this card plus the Gemini Desktop and NVDI, an Atari MegaST gave much more fun.

wikitext: Q-Word is a word game which is a mixture between Tetris and Scrabble.

The program makes the most of the new graphics modes and QL-SSS sound capabilities available on the latest versions of the Sinclair QL, such as the Aurora motherboard, the Q40 and Q60 computers and emulators such as QPC2 and Q-emuLator.  

The aim of the game is simple - you need to clear a grid of letters by making as many words as you can from consecutive letters in the grid.  Points are awarded depending on the letters used as well as the length of the word.

wikipage: QXL Card
wikitext: The QXL card from [Miracle Systems] is a plug-in QL-compatible card for a PC with an ISA card slot. The PC requires DOS or Windows.

This card has a 32 bit 68EC040 processor running at 20MHz (the QXL II had a faster unit), with memory size from 1MB to 8MB. The processor has access to its own RAM so performance is virtually independent of the host PC whether it has an 8088 or Pentium processor. Thus for someone having an old PC lying around for which they have no real use, installing a QXL card can make an otherwise obsolete PC into a high performance QL compatible computer.

Under the QXL, the PC becomes purely an I/O system giving QL programs access to the PC's floppy disc, hard disc, keyboard, display, serial and parallel ports. The QXL has two QL style network ports which are compatible with those of a standard QL, so a QL and QXL can appear on the same network, e.g. the QL can print to the PC's printer if you have both computer systems but only one printer.

Uses the SMSQ operating system, an early version of SMSQ/E without the inbuilt pointer environment. More recently, SMSQ/E also became available for a QXL, and even more recently 16-bit colour drivers have been added to the QXL version of SMSQ/E.

The QXL allows the use of higher resolution displays, so it is possible to use a 640x350, 640x480 or 800x600 pixels display size, as well as the familiar 512x256. You may find that a 512x256 display only uses the top left portion of the screen - this is perfectly normal for a QXL and is not a fault condition.

This card originally cost from £295 for the 1MB version up to £495 for the 8MB version.

No longer made, but second hand units are occasionally available at much lower costs from companies like [RWAP Services].

The 1st Edition (March 1985) was said to contain 100+ references, whereas the 2nd edition (September 1985), this had increased to 300+.

According to the Summer Software Survey in QL User (September 1985), this was an index of QL articles which had appeared in the computing press.

The problem with this, was that it was constantly updating - by October 1985, they had released Edition 5 with 900 references and were promising edition 6 with 1100 references - each edition was said to cost £1 more than the last, with an extra 200 references per references.  Edition 7 was released in December 1985 and included 1300 useful references, with the price at £9 for a microdrive (or 5.25" disk) version.

wikipage: Return to Eden
wikitext: Before Level-9 released its own adventure called Return to Eden, Oliver Neef wrote this text and graphics text adventure for the Sinclair QL.  Originally released in German, it was translated to English and then published by [CGH Services].

The program displays a graphical display of each location and a text description and allows you to control three different characters, all of which have different skills and abilities within the game.

All 3 characters have been sent by the King of Eldomir to the Island of Eden to search for and rescue his son and heir Morkin.

The game is played in real-time, with the passage of night and day affecting what you can do.  The interpreter is also good at allowing English phrases, rather than the normal verb + noun format, so you can use for example, OPEN THE DOOR WITH THE WOODEN KEY.

Originally published for the Sinclair QL computer, thanks to the [QL2K] emulator, [RWAP Adventures] have now released a version for Windows.

The device offers enough capacity to allow an expanded QL to boot up SMSQ/E and all drivers and boot programs from flash memory instead of needing a hard disk. Costs from £39 for the 2MB version, to £98 for the 8MB version. Romdisq was designed by Tony Firshman and Stuart Honeyball of [Miracle Systems], with device drivers written by [Tony Tebby]. 

It uses the device name "ROM" so you can save a program to "ROM1_" for example, like you would save to "FLP1_" or "MDV1_"

wikipage: Sandy
wikitext: Sandy (UK) Personal Computer Products Limited was a company based in Bedford which brought out several hardware products and one software product.  Its products were:

* [Sandy Thru-Con 512K RAM Card] (A 256K or 512K memory expansion unit with through connector)
* [SuperQBoard] (A disk interface with built in parallel port and up to 512K memory)
* [SuperQMouse] (An enhanced version of the Super Q Board, complete with a Mouse interface)
* [Sandy Twin Expansion Unit] Provided slots to allow a standard memory expansion and disk interface to sit side by side.
* [Sandy QXT-640] A Sinclair QL in a PC tower as an all in one solution
* [Sandy Super Disk] A disk interface which supported microdrive emulation.
* [Q-Power Regulator] A replacement power regulator for the Sinclair QL.
* [Sandy FUTURA] An unreleased QL successor based on the [QLT] design by [Tony Tebby].

Sandy also produced their own AT keyboard interface for use with the QXT-640 - see the page on [Keyboards]

Sandy also produced the following software for the Sinclair QL:

* [CADPAK] (A mouse controlled drawing package - for use with the [SuperQMouse])
* [CP/Mulator] (A CP/M Emulator for the Sinclair QL)



Sandy made a brief return to the QL scene in 2010, thanks to a former employee (Dave Park) who had permission to trade under the name of Sandy and aimed to bring more new hardware projects to market - unfortunately he only released some replacement felt pads for microdrive cartridges and some Sinclair QL branded memory sticks.

wikipage: Sandy FUTURA
wikitext: An unreleased QL successor based on the [QLT] design by [Tony Tebby].

Hardware designed in Italy by [Sandy], Software in the UK by [Qjump].

The design objectives were to produce a fast, easy to work with system which would invite expansion by providing designed-in interfacing (rather than the added on afterthought arrangements usually found on home computers at the time).

The Futura was designed around a full Motorola 68000 processor (optionally a 68010 could be used), on a circuit board measuring just 215x225mm.  It was to include QL networking, up to 2 3.5" floppy disk drives, plus a 3.5" hard disk, and up to two double Eurocards or QL expansion cards, with an external PC keyboar, MIDI port, mouse controller, parallel port and two serial ports.

The processor bus was expanded to full VME standard, and a separate bus provided the ability for the display processor to contol RAM access for high speed access.  The system was designed to allow up to seven plug-in ROM/Peripheral modules using reduced bus 48 pin connectors (each supporting up to 256K of address space), and RAM could be upgraded from 512K to 8MB, with the display driver providing 640x380 graphics with 16 colours, with an option fast RAM pallet (supporting up to 65536 colours).

In 2008 an Italian retro computer enthusiast resurrected the remaining prototypes from the hardware designer. The remainders are stored in a wooden box.

In 2010 [Urs Koenig] visited Italy to open Pandora’s box.%%%

wikipage: Sandy QXT-640
wikitext: The QXT-640 was [Sandy]'s answer to the CST Thor 1 computer. 

This was basically an original QL circuit board and a Sandy SuperQMouse built into a plastic PC-style case.

The QXT-640 had a built in 60W power supply, and a powered backplane was connected to the end of the QL, to provide 3 expansion slots.  One slot was used for the Sandy [SuperQMouse] which provided the extra 512K RAM, plus the mouse controls, parallel port, [Toolkit II] and floppy disk interface.

The QL was then connected to a full travel IBM-XT style keyboard (normally using the [QL-Keyboard-90] interface, plus one or two 3.5" floppy drives.  Sandy also provided their own [Keyboards] interface with some versions of the QXT-640.

One of the QL microdrives was moved to the right hand side of the case, strapped underneath one of the floppy disk drives and connected to the QL motherboard using home-made extension leads.

The QXT-640 was available as a complete 1 drive system for £654, or as a twin drive unit for £699. It was also available as a kit of parts and case to upgrade your existing QL from about £259.

The SBASIC/SuperBASIC Reference Manual was devised in the 1990s by Franz Herrmann and Peter Jager, as an update to the Keywords section of the standard Sinclair QL Manual.  The manual takes into account enhancements to [SuperBASIC] since 1984, with the standard toolkits such as [Toolkit II] and [Turbo Toolkit] included, plus many public domain toolkit, the Pointer Environment and the colour drivers also included.

The original draft of the Reference Manual was taken by Rich Mellor of [RWAP Software] and building on from the original concept, sections were also added to replace and enhance the original concepts section of the Sinclair QL Manual, and each keyword has example programs, details of bugs which have been identified over the years and how to overcome those bugs.

The SBASIC/SuperBASIC Reference Manual consists of over 1000 pages of information vital to the SuperBASIC author, and continues to be updated to take account of later enhancements in the QL world.  Originally provided in two large A4 ring binders, the manual was later distributed on CD-ROM in Adobe Acrobat format.

The appendices cover in detail how to use networking on the QL, use of the hi-resolution, hi-colour environment and much more, building on the basic information included in the original QL manual.

Programs are also included with the manual, including the public domain toolkits covered in the manual, the example programs, and also [Q-Index] - an electronic index to the reference manual.


As part of the QL's 30th Anniversary celebrations, the SBASIC/SuperBASIC Reference Manual was converted from the original [Text87 Plus 4] files into simple HTML using a printer filter, and released as a community project.  The HTML output has now been tidied up (with thanks mainly to Norman Dunbar) and the latest version of the manual forms the [SuperBASIC/SBASIC Reference Manual Online|http://superbasic-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]

I came complete with a 64-way 'flip back' connector to allow expansion devices to sit above the QL motherboard PCB. The casing could hold the QL PCB, drives, power supply unit and all expansion devices.

Schön claimed this was a "highly rewarding DIY challenge for the QL owner with the '4 foot long' problem" although they also said in their adverts that this was a "special product intended for the enthusiastic QL owner with electronic knowledge."

The project worked in conjunction with the Schön PS/2 style keyboard.

The KBL 128 originally sold for £65.00

The watch was black with a black metal strap and supported a two line LCD display with a maximum of 12 characters per line.

The watch could be used to display four types of information - memo, yearly schedule, weekly schedule and world times, input from a personal computer.

The memo could be used to store telephone numbers, client lists, important events or dates etc. While the watch had only 2K of memory (a maximum of about 80 telephone numbers), it still gave you the ability to carry important information about with you. 

The watch itself only allowed you to view the data, you could only set the time, the date and a daily alarm on the watch.

Data-Skip provided QL transmission software, the connection cable and the watch for £49.95. A Spectrum version was available too. And in case you thought, yes, it could tell the time too.

We have preserved a copy of the software

Sideways is a printer utility which works with any program written with an Epson FX-80 compatible driver (ie. ESC/P).  It states that the printer must support user-defined graphics.

It allows you to turn the output 90 degrees to provide landscape printing of text, diagrams and spreadsheets.

QL Sideways also has the facility to shrink or expand the characters to be printed (text sizes range from 17 lines per inch by 27 characters per inch to 5 lines per inch by 8 characters per inch), allowing data tables or spreadsheets of up to 297 characters wide by 127 lines high to be shrunk for printing out on single sheets of A4 paper.

The program also supports the option to print documents in booklet form, printing on both sides of the sheet, either in single bound (stapled or bound at the left hand edge), or centre bound, where a document printed on A4 will be stapled and bounds in the centre and folded to A5.

Comments from the Author:
>^^I wrote "Sideways" when I was working in the copper mines in Zambia, because I wanted to be able to do layouts & as a bit of fun to "get under the hood" of the computer. It was published by Talent just at the time I was leaving Zambia, and the manual was written on a farm called Pontrydfendigaid in Wales, when we had left Zambia and were waiting for immigration clearance to take up a job in the Australian Outback. I wrote several other pieces of software for the QL, but for personal use (and for our children). Sideways is the only piece of software I have ever sold commercially & even then just for the experience & to see my name in print for something outside my professional field. The hassle of tidying up software for others to use was simply not worth the relatively modest financial return.^^

>^^I no longer have even the source code, but it was effectively platform independent, and relied the capability of the Epson FX-80 and similar printers to be able to redefine the character set. The memory (and processing power!) of the QL was not sufficient to bit-map the whole printable image, so it was a matter of redefining the character sets sideways & then doing some relatively simple work to scale the fonts to fit & sort out the eventual layouts.^^

>^^By the way, the program would also allow the use of fan-fold paper to make posters and banners.^^

wikipage: Sidewriter
wikitext: Sidewriter is a program which allows you to print text files or spreadsheets created with Abacus or with Qspread sideways on a printer, thus making it easy to print anything which is wider than 80 letters. A wide range of fonts are supported, and the program works with all Epson compatible 9-pin and 24-pin printers, Epson ESC/P2 printers, plus inkjets which include an Epson compatible mode.

Simply create a spreadsheet with Abacus and use the export to Quill function. Then run Sidewriter, select a few options and print out the file as required, adding lines between columns as necessary. The same effect can be achieved by printing out a spreadsheet created with Qspread as an ascii file.

The program can be run with or without the pointer environment, making it easy to install and use by anyone.

The program was released as freeware in 2016 as part of the 30th Anniversary of RWAP Software.

wikipage: Sigma Research Parallel Printer Interface
wikitext: The Sigma Research Parallel Printer Interface was a serial to parallel printer interface, which was very similar to the first version of the [Miracle Centronics Interface].

The baud rate was fixed at 9600.  There was a cable to the QL, and a second cable to the printer, with a metal centronics connector.

According to the review in QL User (December 1984), this centronics connector has a UART specifically designed for inputting serial data, and a ceramic resonator on the PCB, to give more accurate clock frequencies.  The chips were also said to be CMOS type, resulting in a very low power consumption.

They also offered a 512K expanderam and a disk drive.

They also supplied one of the [internal 512K memory upgrade]s at a cost of £150 (although the stop press on their September 1985 QL User advert said £199!)- this appears to have been a version whereby they replaced the QL's RAM chips, providing a total of 512K only, rather than the 640K which you could obtain using other 512K RAM upgrades.

Oddly the internal 512K memory upgrade was first advertised in QL User (September 1985), whereas Sinclair QL World (September 1985) advertised the [512K Memory Insider Board] for £259.95.

This memory interface plugged into the QL expansion slot and had either 256K or 512K RAM on board and no through connector.

It was produced by [Simplex Data Logic Limited].

The interface measured approximately 97mm x 77mm and fitted completely inside the QL, which made it difficult to remove unless you open up the QL !

Prices were :%%%
*256K RAM: £198
*512K RAM: £396

Their adverts in 1985 showed a different memory expansion which fitted outside of the QL and had a heatsink built in.  It still lacked a through connector however, and prices were reduced to £99+VAT for the 256K version and £149.90+VAT for the 512K version.

wikitext: The Sinclair Floppy Disk system was a Sinclair badged disk interface card for the QL and 720K DSDD 3.5" disk drive(s) made my Micro Peripherals Ltd.

Its device driver (FDK) was largely incompatible with the more common FLP device driver at the time, in that it used its own extensions, not those designed by [QJump] which were used in most disc interfaces at the time. It included non-standard commands such as DGET and DPUT, SAVEO and SBYTESO which allowed you to overwrite existing files and the driver also used a different drive name (FDK) compared to the drive name FLP used by most at the time. However, Micro Peripherals claimed to have improved timings in the Sinclair version (v5.3) providing faster disk access.

Floppy Disks (media) were compatible between all device drivers.

[QJump] released their standard device driver FLP as an upgrade ROM called QFLP for the Micro Peripherals/Sinclair Floppy Disk system.

wikitext: !!!Introduction
((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/hardware/sinclair_ql.jpg|Sinclair QL Home Computer|align="L"|A Sinclair QL Home Computer|240|180|POPUP))
The Sinclair QL Home Computer was released in 1984 - the successor to the earlier Sinclair computers, the ZX80, ZX81 and ZX Spectrum.

The QL was launched as a business machine, complete with two built in Sinclair ZX Microdrives, 128K, full sized keyboard and 4 business programs by [Psion] (Quill - Word-processor, Archive - Database program, Easel - Business Graphics and Charts, Abacus - Spreadsheet) and a powerful [SuperBASIC].  The display memory is 32K in size and supports two standard modes - 4 colours in 512x256 pixels, or 8 colours in 256x256 pixels (each individual pixel in the 8 colour mode can also have a flash attribute).

Alas the early QLs suffered from unreliable v1 Psion software, unreliable microdrives and a third of the ROM being present in a "dongle" (also known as a "Kludge" in the back of the QL. This led to quite a lot of bad press unfortunately. However, an updated version of the QL and Psion software was soon released, and the QL has remained popular amongst a hardcore of users, with 2 replacement operating systems (Minerva and SMSQ/E), numerous emulators for other computers, and even 16 bit colour drivers.

A wide range of business and games software has been released over the years, and the QL is still supported by some traders, a user group ([Quanta|http://www.quanta.org.uk|eng-uk|Quanta User Group]), which organises QL workshops and publishes a bi-monthly magazine.  Up until 2013, there was even an independent quarterly magazine ([QL Today|http://www.sinclairql.net/repository.html#QLToday|eng-uk|QL Today Magazine website]). 

Other sources of help and information are via the popular [emailing forum|http://lists.q-v-d.com/listinfo.cgi/ql-users-q-v-d.com|eng-uk|QL User Mailing List] and [web based forum|http://www.qlforum.co.uk] for discussion of all things QL related.

wikipage: Sinclair Wafer RAM Expansion
wikitext: The Sinclair Wafer RAM Expansion was to be the first product by [Sinclair Research Ltd] which used Wafer Scale Integration.

Wafer Scale Integration was an idea which had been around for many years, whereby instead of breaking a silicon wafer into small pieces, which are used to form a silicon chip, the circuit occupies the whole surface area of the silicon wafer (several inches across).

Integrated logic control (invented by Ivor Catt) is then used to bypass any parts of the silicon wafer which are found to be faulty, and the circuit re-routed.

The benefit of this was to be reduced price (as splitting parts off the wafer and testing individual chips was expensive), plus speed of operation.

The wafer scale integration was reported to be progressing well with an expected 512K memory card for the Sinclair QL planned as the first product, with a price of around £200.  It was planned that it would be battery backed, so that it could store data when the power was switched off, turning it into a fast replacement for a Winchester hard disk.

Unfortunately, the project appears to have been abandoned, as the world price for standard memory chips collapsed, making them much more affordable.

wikitext: Sketch Pad is a drawing package from Sigma Research of Cambridge which could be used with either the cursor keys or a joystick.

The program works by allowing you to draw ellipses, circles, rectangles and arcs to build up your picture, adding text in a variety of sizes and then allowing you to alter the colours and fill shapes before saving the picture or printing it out.

The save function does not output a standard screen dump - instead it produces a listing of the objects drawn saving hundreds of bytes per picture (but making it slower to redraw the screen in the future).

Advertised features included:
*Screen dump to any Epson compatible printer
*Microdrive save and load of screens
*Use of stipple gives a vast range of colours
*Graphics and text can be freely mixed
*Automatic drawing of many shapes
*Filling of regular or irregular shapes in any colour
*Drawings saved on microdrive can be redisplayed from within any SuperBASIC program using simple procedures supplied on microdrive

wikipage: Software
wikitext: Despite its initial launch as a system designed for the business market, some of the first programs released for the Sinclair QL were games software, which made the most of its screen with 4 colours in 512x256 resolution, or 8 colours in 256 x 256 resolution.  Many of the early games were based on classic games produced for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, although enhanced ot make full use of the higher screen resolution, with later games software taking advantage of the higher speed, and graphics resolutions available on emulators and the [Aurora] replacement motherboard.

A wide range of programming utilities were also released, aimed fully at the reputation which the SInclair QL had for attracting tinkerers interested in learning to program on the QL and to use all of its facilities (indeed the QL user group - Quanta is actually short for QL Users and Tinkerers Association).

Business and programming software also blossomed on the QL, with Sage basing their later PC versions of accounts packages on the original Sinclair QL accounting packages, and Linus Torvalds (the author of the Linux operating system) also learned a lot of his art on the humble Sinclair QL, writing his own assembler program, text editor and games for the machine.

The following is intended to be a full list of all the software titles published for the Sinclair QL, with links to pages within this wiki.

====
[Arcade Games] 

From platforms to shoot 'em ups, the Sinclair QL's original 4 colours in 512x256 resolution or 8 colours in 256x256 pixels (with the ability to add flash to each pixel) heralded a surprisingly wide range of Arcade Games.  Later developments, such as the Aurora graphics motherboard and QL emulators enhanced the resolution, both in terms of pixels and colours, which has been further used to develop better arcade games.

This section forms a list of the most popular arcade games for the Sinclair QL

[Board Games]

A series of classic board games was produced for the Sinclair QL, including backgammon, othello and chess.

[Card Games]

Various games were released for the Sinclair QL based on popular card games.

[Other Types of Games]

Various other types of games were released for the Sinclair QL which do not fit into the standard Board Games or Arcade Games category.

[Graphic Adventures]

Although most adventure games written for the Sinclair QL were text only, as authors began to realise the full capability of the QL's graphic system, we started to see a shift towards graphic adventures, where everything was controlled by the joystick or cursor keys and people did not have to understand how to use the complicated parsers which tried to understand your commands.

[Text Adventures]

Soon after the Sinclair QL was launched in 1984, text adventures were offered by various software houses - [Lost Kingdom of Zkul] was the first one produced, which was a realtime adventure.  Perhaps the most famous was [QL Pawn] by [Magnetic Scrolls], which was (alas) the only Level-9 adventure to make it to the Sinclair QL.  Later adventures incorporated a mixture of text and graphics, and tools which enabled the QL's screen to be split so that the top half was in Mode 8 (for graphics) and the bottom half in Mode 4 (for text) ensured that adventures really took off on the QL.

[Educational Software]

There does not appear to have been a great deal of educational software produced for the Sinclair QL - maybe it was thought that the kids were all too busy playing games on the ZX Spectrum (a foreboding of times to come!)

[Business Software]

Bearing in mind that the Sinclair QL was originally launched as a small business machine, it is no surprise that a wealth of programs were released which were aimed squarely at the Business market.

[Utilities]

The Sinclair QL really took off as a programmers and hobbyists dream computer - as a result a wide range of utilities were produced for the computer, many of which built on the simple menu structure which was introduced through [Psion]'s [Quill] word processor and then switching to the graphical icon interface, which was made popular on the Apple Macintosh.

[QL Front Ends]

The QL was born in an age which predated even DOS, everything was command line driven, and one program loaded in at a time.  The Sinclair QL introduced the prospect of multitasking to the computer world, and with extra memory and better bigger storage mediums, front ends were introduced to make it easier to select which program you wished to launch and switch between running jobs (programs).

[Languages]

Various programming languages were produced for the Sinclair QL, including many ported from other computers.

[Emulators]

Various emulators were produced for the Sinclair QL to enable it to emulate other computers, such as the Sinclair ZX81, ZX Spectrum, IBM PC and CP/M based computers.

wikipage: Software Production Kit
wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/Superbasic-Production-Kit.jpg|SuperBASIC Production Kit|align="I"|SuperBASIC Production Kit by Sinclair Research))%%%
The Software Production Kit (SPK) is designed to help commercialise software products.  It is called 'QL SuperBASIC Production Kit' in the boot file.

The kit provides several machine code routines to extend SuperBASIC which could be incorporated into programs published under licence from Sinclair.

The tools included new SuperBASIC keywords for fast image loading of programs written in SuperBASIC, which could add standard copy protection to these programs (requiring the user to have the original key cartridge in either mdv1_ or mdv2_).  The commands also prevented the user from using BREAK to get at a program (although it also meant that error messages were not displayed if the user found a bug in the program). 

The full SPK included the commands FLOAD (Fast Load), FSAVE (Save the Fast Image) and FBOOT (Create key cartridge).
A runtime version was provided which could be included with released software, containing the FLOAD routine.  We have also come across a version of the SPK with the command FMERGE (Fast Merge).

Other functions (taken from the later launched [QL Toolkit]) included fixed decimal point conversion, error trapped input / output and random file access.

The kit includes the GST linker and a pre-assembled SROFF file. A SuperBASIC program then starts the linker with pre-defined command lines to produce the user defined toolkit (the well known filename "_").

The first version of SPK saved the main program as a file with no name, so "copy mdv1_ to scr" gave a result. This was changed in a later version to "mdv1_ " (mdv1_ &CHR$(32)) to give the file a real name, even it was a space.

The kit also includes a few SuperBASIC programs for bulk copying the user defined toolkit, the "magic number" of the microdrive (for copy protection) and the corresponding user programs.

Programs, which are FSAVEd with this kit will run successfully on QLs and Atari Level up to D. They do not run on QPC2. FSAVEd programs have the nametable saved in the program image (a bit similar to QSAVE), this crashes in modern SMSQ/E systems because the name table gets overwritten during loading.

Quite a few of the programs sold under the Sinclair label were produced using this kit.

There seem to be other versions of SPK, as there are toolkit files ("_") which contained other procedures, not included in the standard SPK. An example is the range of programs from [Triptych], where the procedure "UDG" is contained in the toolkit file to print bullets and squares on the screen, although it may of course be that they just merged additional machine code functions into the toolkit file. It is not known, whether this was done by Tony Tebby himself or the various software companies.

SPK was an early and quick way from [Sinclair Research Ltd] for software companies to protect their software, but unfortunately it was cracked, as soon as the programs were launched, which was then a problem because the software all used the same protection method. Other companies, e.g. [Sellasoft] with [Tankbusters] or [Talent Computer Systems] with [Cartridge Doctor] developed much better ways to protect their programs.

This is based on a table top racing game, similar to Scalextric, apart from the fact that there are no grooves to keep you on the right track.

You race four other cars controlled by the computer as they make their way around the course - you need to complete the four laps of each track in first place, otherwise you will be knocked out.  

Go to fast and you will be destroyed at the edge of the track.  Incorporates bridges and tunnels, as well as oil slicks!

Excellent graphics and not easy to complete.

wikipage: Speedscreen
wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/speedscreen_package.jpg|Sinclair QL Speedscreen|align="i"|Sinclair QL Speedscreen by Simon Goodwin))%%%

Speedscreen was a revolutionary software product, written by [Simon Goodwin] and published by him under the name of Creative Codeworks.

Speedscreen optimised QL display handling by replacing slow, general-purpose code in the QL ROM with new, fast routines.

Programs did not need to be altered to make use of the new routines which automatically took over from the QL ROM's native routines for text, graphics and scrolling.

Speedscreen was first produced on disc and microdrive cartridge for the Sinclair QL, then as a ROM for the CST Thor range of computers, and later as a plug-in ROM cartridge for the QL (saving RAM and boosting speed).

Speedscreen worked by using optimised routines for scrolling, printing in CSIZEs 0,0 and 1,0,
window clearing and cursor operations. Speedscreen also optimises all OVER and UNDER settings, solid colours and 64 stipples.

The improvement in speed compared with a standard QL depends on the operation: text output is typically between four and twelve times faster than normal. 

By default, Speedscreen scrolling was about twice the normal speed: for example when COPYing to SCR. 

New commands (_SCROLL)were added to allow you to set higher speeds for free-scrolling displays such as LIST and COPY - you could actually scroll up to eight times faster than normal.

Speedscreen also allows larger founts (on a bigger matrix, for clearer characters) than the Sinclair ROM routines, and multi-coloured founts, and comes with some useful text-related utilities and toolkit commands.

A limited version of Speedscreen - very fast in CSIZE 1,0 but supporting only one size and fount - was put in the Quanta library and available from QL public domain software libraries.

A free full version of the Speedscreen ROM (as a software image for the hardware ROM cartridge emulation) is available to users of the [QL2K] emulator. It also comes with comprehensive documentation.

__History of Speedscreen__ - taken from [Simon Goodwin]'s [webpage|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL|eng|History of Software by Simon Goodwin]...

^^SpeedScreen was a replacement display device driver for Sinclair QL and CST Thor computers. It made common display operations much faster and so benefited all users of those systems - even those normally happy to use just the bundled software supplied with the machine. It taught me that - after years writing compilers - it was easier to sell speed by enhancing what people already had, than by giving them new ways to make fresh and speedier applications themselves.|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^ 

^^SpeedScreen was initially sold on microdrives and 5.25" and 3.5" floppy discs, priced at £20 with a 16 page manual. Later it was released in ROM chip form, making the code even quicker (as the ROM was faster than the DMA-contended RAM in most systems) and leaving more room for applications - and giving me the chance to sell the same thing a second time to willing customers, at the same price or £30 for a bundle of both the ROM and disc or tape versions (which included additional utilities).|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^ 

^^SpeedScreen optimised display handling by replacing slow, general-purpose code in the system ROMs with fast replacement routines. You didn't need to alter your programs to use it - just load SpeedScreen before loading€and using your application. The only difference (apart from a small memory overhead - configurable between 4.5 and 17K) was the extra speed.|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

^^SpeedScreen optimised scrolling, printing in the most common character sizes, window clearing and cursor operations. The improvement in speed compared with a standard QL depended on the operation: text output was typically between four and twelve times faster than normal. SpeedScreen optimised all OVER and UNDER settings, solid colours and 64 stipples.|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^ 

^^By default, SpeedScreen scrolling was at about twice the normal speed, but a new command let you set higher speeds - up to eight times normal - for free-scrolling displays such as LIST and COPY, letting users adjust the rate to control flicker and match their reading speed. Further new commands allowed extra character-sizes, coloured fonts and other features that came almost for free out of the code I'd rewritten.|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^ 

^^The QL's original display handling code had been written in a great rush and squashed into a very small amount of memory. So routines were chosen for their generality, rather than their speed. Thus one routine prints characters in all CSIZEs and for all values of INK, PAPER, OVER and UNDER. A single tangled block of code was used to scroll and pan, to print blocks and borders, to draw and erase cursors and to clear all or part of any window, regardless of its position. SpeedScreen avoided those slow routines and uses its own fast code instead.|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^ 

^^SpeedScreen emulated Sinclair's OS accurately, despite its speed. Displays looked just the same, but appeared much more quickly, though pausing and interruption was supported as before. The code was device-independent and re-entrant, so one copy of SpeedScreen boosted any€number of windows and concurrently-running tasks. Apart from a slight tweak to the MODE command (which changes display resolution) all system commands worked as before. Features that were not optimised were handled exactly as usual, at normal speed, and could be mixed with optimised text or graphics without restriction. So I only needed to rewrite the bits of the API I could speed up usefully, and could revert to existing code for all the rest.|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^ 

^^SpeedScreen sold thousands of copies by direct mail order and through dealers in the six months I advertised it. All the duplication and order fulfillment was handled by student friends of mine, paid generously for a quick turn-around. Raw material costs were tiny. Soon after, my former publisher brought out a clone product, heralded by full-page advertisements, (using a brand name I'd thought up for another product he'd since canned!) [Lightning] and I moved on. Exploiting good ideas depends upon timing, at the start and the end, and you have to move fast! As long as you do that you need not fear copyists, because you'll keep having new ideas and they'll always be several steps behind.|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

wikitext: A video digitiser interface which plugged into the EPROM slot on the QL. Produced by Italian company SPEM, this could work on an unexpanded QL, although some memory expansion was preferred. The unit had three slider controls which controlled the level of Red, Green and Blue in the picture.

The SPEM digitiser allowed most video cameras and recorders to be plugged into a QL to sample pictures. The software supplied with it allowed a limited manipulation of the pictures captured. The unit was cased in black, with a sloping front panel and a neat brushed-metal effect panel.

wikitext: This is an icon controlled graphic adventure based in space.

Following the effects of global warming and pollution in 2088, ten thousand colonists were put into suspended animation by the Galactic Federation (Gal-Fed) on board a vast space ship (Space Base).  You wake up two million years later to find yourself in a solar system which has long-since been abandoned to pirates by the Gal-Fed explorers.

Unfortunately, during your long sleep, the life-support systems generator was damaged and the backup supply of Moronium fuel was lost - leaving just a few days fuel left.

You are sent out from the Space Base in its small exploratory craft in search of the previous mineral.  You will need to Hyperdrive around the planets and then land on them to fulfill your task.

The screen is split into four sections - an image of the current location, description of the exits at the top, with a description of the location underneath, and then 20 command icons below this.

Steve Davis Snooker was a colourful implementation of Snooker, based on the version for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum from the same company.

You can play either against the computer (Steve Davis), or a second player and although the controls appear to be straightforward, the game requires a lot of skill to pot balls without making mistakes.  You have to choose direction, spin on the cue ball and strength of shot.

A QL emulator card for Atari ST computers, originally developed 1987 by [Futura Datasenter] AS in Norway, then marketed by [Jochen Merz] Software in Germany and [Strong Computers] in GB. The original Futura Datasenter version featured only standard QL screen modes with four colours (also in MODE 8) and needed an ZX8301 (ULA 1) plugged into the board. There was also a later version, which featured MODE 8 with eight colours, but no FLASH. Fitting of the card was the same procedure as it was with the later launched "Extended Emulator" (see below).

Futura Datasenter supplied two disks: An Atari formatted one to start the system and a QL formatted one. The QL formatted one included a SuperBASIC program for the QL to save the JS ROM and to patch it for supporting 4MB of RAM. This had to be done in the first place. For copyright reasons, they did not included the patched JS ROM. The card only works with this special patched version of a JS ROM. Other ROM versions (JM, MGx, Minerva etc.) were not supported.

The original I/O drivers from Futura Datasenter made the behaviour of the Atari disk drive very rough and noisy and did not support any harddisk. But there was a cure:

Later in 1987, [Tony Tebby], being very enthusiastic about the 6+ speed (compared to a standard QL), produced his first Atari QL drivers, which let the disk drives on the Atari behave as silent as usual and later versions of his drivers added support for the native Atari ACSI harddisks and third-party harddisk controllers. These I/O drivers were totally new written (and taken from the later launched SMS drivers) to help the user out from copyright problems as the drivers from Futura Datasenter were patched QL I/O drivers and not officially allowed to be sold.

A later version of the STQL hardware emulator, different and newly built from JMS, the "Extended Emulator", featured an enhanced resolution mode, 768x280 and didn't need an ULA ZX8301 anymore. A version of SMSQ/E is available for these as is a version of [The Painter] from [PROGS] (for 768x280 and really round circles). JMS made a great effort in his manuals to place this emulator in existing versions of the Atari MegaST, as there were several hardware versions around. Fitting the board in the MegaST wasn't very easy as the Glue chip has to be pulled out (very strong fastened), a pin bend out, then soldered to the emulator, then the Glue chip put in again and several cables soldered to the Shifter chip.

Later came the [QVME Card] for Atari STe, TT with VME card slots and MegaST (with VME BUS adaptor).

__BMX Burner__ %%%
A space arcade adventure where you need to ride your supercharged BMX space bike by Derek Jones.

You zoom around a series of screens, avoiding the guardians and collecting objects in the right order in order to open the exit to the next level.  There are missiles which you can pick up and drop in the path of a guardian to destroy them.

__Grid Racer__ %%%
A grid-runner/painter game which forms a race against time by Ian Robinson.

You need to move your man around the screen to get to a bomb before it explodes - however, you cannot go back over your own trail, so you have to consider your route carefully, as one bomb follows another.  There are mines laced on the grid, so be careful of these, but there is also a useful shuffle command to move the grid and your trail to the left and right, which may help you get out of dead ends.

The pace of the game soon increases, with chasers and the dreaded boot.

The successor to the [Gold Card] from [Miracle Systems]. It has a 68020 processor, making it about 3 times as fast as a [Gold Card] and 4MB of RAM. It also has a Centronics parallel printer port and two twin disc drive connectors, allowing it to access up to 4 disc drives. It also has a socket for an external 5V power supply, to make it easier to build a QL system into a PC-style case. Miracle claimed it had a "virtually crash-proof" clock, and they even supplied a printer cable with the Super Gold Card. The Super Gold Card was originally sold for £375.

When [Miracle Systems] stopped selling the Super Gold Card, a small second batch was made by Quanta, which soon sold out.

The Super Gold Card is a popular QL expansion for those who prefer to use an original Sinclair QL. Although rare now (once people get hold of one they rarely sell them!), units do occasionally become available through traders like [RWAP Services].

Super Sprite Generator is a program for designing and embedding moving sprites in your SuperBASIC or 68000 machine code programs.

This program allows you to design any number of sprites and show up to 16 sprites on screen at a time.  Each sprite can have 16 shape frames for animation and up to 256 different planes can be used to control the depth of movement.

The provided routines will perform real time collision detection (both sprite-sprite and sprite-object), as well as screen border detection

Advertised features included:
*Superspeed sprite compiler
*Sprite management procedures
*Advanced sprite creation editor
*Library of SuperBASIC extensions
*Demonstration sprites 
*100% variable speed - at top speed the motion is faster than the eye can see!
*Ultra large sprites possible
*Solid and ghostly sprites are handled
*Full over/under/hit/miss logic
*A total of 37 files provided
*Sprite reversal and inversion
*Automatic real-time collision detection (both Sprite-Sprite with identity, and Sprite-object)
*Create up to 256 Sprites in total (from v3)
*Choice of automatic sprite drawing in the background (from v3)
*Choice of automatic sprite movement (from v3)
*Each sprite can have its own independent speed (from v3)

Unfortunately, the resulting files flicker when used on current versions of q-emulator.

The original version was said to require a SuperBASIC command each time a sprite was to be moved. We have preserved v4.0 of the software

wikipage: SuperBASIC
wikitext: SuperBASIC is the BASIC programming language devised for the Sinclair QL.  It was written by [Jan Jones|http://www.jan-jones.co.uk/aboutme.html] and was based on the original Sinclair ZX BASIC written for the ZX80, ZX81 and ZX Spectrum home computers.

SuperBASIC has lots of very useful features, including easily controlled loops, procedures and functions and the ability to easily add further functionality through machine code procedures and functions.

The [Minerva Replacement ROM] for the Sinclair QL permits users to run mutliple copies of SuperBASIC at the same time (multitasking).  This feature has also been replicated and enhanced in the [SMSQ/e Replacement Operating System].

There are many guides to programming in SuperBASIC, with probably the most comprehensive guides being the [SBASIC/SuperBASIC Reference Manual] by [RWAP Software] and [QL SuperBASIC (The Definitive Handbook)] by [Jan Jones|http://www.jan-jones.co.uk/aboutme.html].

A compiler takes the contents of a BASIC program and undertakes various processes in order to convert it to a much faster program which can run in Machine Code.

Not all compilers operate in the same way, as some generate intermediate code which is then interpreted at runtime, whereas others generate pure machine code.

There are three different SuperBASIC Compilers which were produced for the QL:

Written by Eddy Yeung, this was said to be "the fastest QL game".

Featuring excellent graphics you have to fly through a series of caverns avoiding the ground to air missiles and destroying alien spaceships trying to shoot you down.  You can refuel by destroying a fuel depot. 

Interestingly, if you hold down the space bar (fire), you shoot horizontal bullets, however, to drop bombs you have to release it, so forcing you to make rapid presses of the space bar or fire button on a QL joystick.

This probably formed the inspiration for [Deathstrike] which is very similar in look and feel.

wikipage: Supercharge
wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/supercharge_package.jpg|Digital Precision SuperCharge QL Package|align="i"|Sinclair QL SuperCharge by Digital Precision))%%%

Supercharge is the original QL SuperBASIC compiler from the 1980s. This was written by [Simon Goodwin], with the Code Generator for SuperCharge being written by Gerry Jackson, author of [SuperForth] and marketed by [Digital Precision Ltd]. 

The original version used a software protection system called Lenslok, which meant you had to look at symbols on the screen through a special Lens device and type in what you saw before you could use the program. 

Programs compiled with SuperCharge could be distributed free of any royalties, although software houses were required to pay £250 for a site licence (in addition to the cost of the program itself).

Supercharge compiled the majority of SuperBASIC, producing fast executable programs. A later version of Supercharge, called Supercharge Special Edition was also produced.  The Special Edition was basically the same program, but without the Lenslock protection used in the original.

According to the advertising, the standard PCW Benchmarks (as per PCW June 1984) showed the following speed improvements:

*PCW Benchmark 1: SuperBASIC 2.1, SuperCharge (floating point) 0.2, SuperCharge (Integers) 0.06 seconds
*PCW Benchmark 2: SuperBASIC 6.4, SuperCharge (floating point) 0.3, SuperCharge (Integers) 0.1 seconds
*PCW Benchmark 3: SuperBASIC 10.7, SuperCharge (floating point) 1.2, SuperCharge (Integers) 0.3 seconds
*PCW Benchmark 4: SuperBASIC 10.3, SuperCharge (floating point) 0.9, SuperCharge (Integers) 0.3 seconds
*PCW Benchmark 5: SuperBASIC 13.2, SuperCharge (floating point) 1.0, SuperCharge (Integers) 0.3 seconds
*PCW Benchmark 6: SuperBASIC 26.1, SuperCharge (floating point) 2.5, SuperCharge (Integers) 0.7 seconds
*PCW Benchmark 7: SuperBASIC 61.8, SuperCharge (floating point) 4.1, SuperCharge (Integers) 1.0 seconds
*PCW Benchmark 8: SuperBASIC 25.8, SuperCharge (floating point) 8.6, SuperCharge (Integers) n/a

Some programs compiled with Supercharge may not work on the more modern QL systems, which have differing memory layouts and so on, although some users have produced patches for some of these programs. Compiled programs usually needed a small set of compiler extensions to be included with the program (not linked into the program) to run, linked in by a simple RESPR/LBYTES/CALL or LRESPR command.

The code generator was later expanded greatly to be included in the [Turbo] compiler.

__History of SuperCharge__ - taken from [Simon Goodwin]'s [webpage|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL|eng|History of Software by Simon Goodwin]...

^^Soon after I finished the first version of Zip (''A ZX BASIC compiler for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum'') I returned to Aston University and needed to come up with a proposal for a final-year project. Having learned by that time that the only thing you can be sure of delivering on time is something you've finished already, but wanting to do something new and cool if I got the chance, and delve into the Motorola 68008 processor in Sinclair's new QL home computer, I proposed 'a compiler for Sinclair BASIC' as my project.|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^ 

^^With luck this could be a compiler for Sinclair SuperBASIC - the vastly improved, Comal-based interpreter programmed by Jan Jones and built into the QL's ROM, alongside Tony Tebby's Unix-influenced Qdos operating system - but if I got stuck, or busy with something or someone else (maybe even a girlfriend?) I reckoned I could fall back on ZIP and still earn the degree.|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

^^Staff at Quicksilva obtained early Qdos documentation from Sinclair on my behalf, and I got a QL from the second batch at the end of May 1984, then another one which worked (the first lasted only 45 minutes) in June. I made steady progress, first writing code on my 128K microdrive-based system to read the tokenised program source from QL memory - then routines to parse the result and generate corresponding code in the form of calls to intermediate code and stack operations expressed in Reserve Polish Notation. This text output was written to microdrive tape and later - once I got onto Metacomco's Macro Assembler beta-test program - converted into 68000 machine code by expanding the text, via assembler macros. |http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

^^This was enough to prove the symbols table and expression evaluation code, and get benchmarks compiled and running as standalone multi-tasking processes, but the generated code was far too verbose to give me any chance of making the compiled compiler fit on the machine. Like Zip, this was a four-pass compiler, working from tokenised source in the interpreter's memory. The first pass collected information about the whole source, to enable robust error checks later on. The second pass converted the source into an intermediate code and reported all errors. Only if that worked - and most programs submitted for compilation fail at this point - were two more passes used to translate the intermediate code and fix up cross-references to make a stand-alone code file. The use of compilation from memory made the extra pre-pass fast, and the separate code-generation phase simplified the design and allowed the machine code library to overlay the compiler, making best use of limited RAM and the microdrives - good for large block loads but slow for sequential filing. |http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

^^The following spring a demo to my supervisor went well and that and the report earned me a first class honours for the project. By the time I graduated I was looking for a publisher, who could turn the compiler into a product as Quicksilva were no longer interested in the QL and in the throes of selling out to Argus Press.|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

^^Freddy Vachha was setting up Digital Precision as a specialist QL publisher at the time, and set me up with a 720K CST 5.25" floppy disk system, 256K extra RAM from Simplex Data, and an advance which I immediately spent on the HiFi system I'd always wanted but never been able to afford....|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

^^It took another year to develop the academic project into a commercial product - QL Supercharge, £60 boxed with a 100 page manual (written in Scripsit on my Video Genie, printed with a Juki 6100 daisywheel printer). The compiler ran overnight for weeks, parsing itself in slow interpreted BASIC, usually to fall over in the small hours with some unanticipated problem. The aim was to get it to compile itself, and after weeks of trying it got all the way to the end and emitted a complete intermediate file. A few weeks later that assembled into an executable program. It took weeks more to get that to compile itself, and further weeks to get the compiled compiler to match the compiled compiled compiler! Compiler bootstrapping is not as simple, or as easy, as academics often make it seem. |http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

^^To meet the challenge to get from intermediate to executable code, Freddy enlisted Ferranti CPU designer and Open University lecturer Gerry Jackson, author of [SuperForth], DP's first QL compiler, to write a custom code-generator to take the place of the Metacomco assembler. In the process the design was refined to optimise the speed and size of the generated code. |http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

^^Memory was tight - it had to run on a 128K computer with only microdrives, and fit the compiler, its source and intermediate code in RAM (buffered in screen memory for want of anywhere else) so the third and fourth passes only loaded, over the top of the parser, if the code was guaranteed correct. It compiled to an intermediate language which the code-generator could optimise and convert to either 16 bit threaded code (like Forth) or pure 68K code selectable on a per-line basis, and then generated a dynamically-built library to run the threading so the overhead of despatching between templates (16 bit code pointers) was only two instructions:|http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

  move.w (a5)+,d0%%%
  jmp    0(a6,d0.w)%%%

^^Most of the machine-code from the macros could be encoded into a single 16 bit word, followed by any parameters (fetched with move (a5)+ from the threaded code stream) yet raw machine code could be inserted into the instruction stream at any point the maximum speed was essential, prefixed with jmp (a5) to switch out of threaded code, followed by reloading a5 and restarting the threaded code above when space was more important than speed. |http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

^^Once Supercharge had compiled itself the overnight runs were reduced to about 20 minutes at first, then trimmed to nine minutes for the compiler to re-compile itself after optimisation of the code. The code itself shrank from about 80K of tokens to just 46.5K of compiled code, including the template library, threads and initialised data - leaving room for 30K of source and 9K of compile-time data on the unexpanded QL - the other 40K being taken up by the screen (32K, mostly used to buffer intermediate code during passes three and four) and the Qdos multi-tasking operating system structures and device linkage. |http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

^^Supercharge was unveiled in an article in the October 1985 issue of QL User magazine and went on to earn a 'Sinclair User Classic' award and sold thousands of copies over the following couple of years. Some of these sales were gained - and doubtless some lost - by the revolutionary system of copy-protection built into the product - the infamous Lenslok. |http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

__LensLok__

^^Lenslok, from ASAP Developments, consisted of a plastic holder for a transparent slatted lens which scrambled the image on screen over which it was placed, making nonsense of a normal bit-mapped display but shuffling a correctly pre-scrambled pattern into readable text. The user was required to read two characters through the lens and type them in at the start of each compiler run, to prove that they had a genuine copy of the compiler - or at least a copy of the lens, which was much harder to copy than the unprotected 100K microdrive tape on which Supercharge was shipped. |http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

^^Lenslok became infamous that year when the programmers who bolted it onto the Spectrum version of 80s classic game Elite misread the instructions and generated a pattern which could not be read reliably, with or without the lens. The QL's floating point scaled graphics and high resolution meant that the Supercharge patterns were readable and readily compatible with various sizes of TV and monitor, though after a few days many users learned to shuffle the rows by eye and live without the lens. |http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

^^Lenslok was very successful in dissuading commercial pirates from selling Supercharge, until some ingenious thieves in Belgium found a way to make the compiler defeat its own copy protection. The rip-off copies of Supercharge sold by [Persoft Software] in early 1986 came with a small program - itself compiled with Supercharge and hence able to multi-task alongside the compiler itself - which read the screen memory where the Lenslok pattern was displayed, re-ordered the data and displayed it alongside 'in clear'. |http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

^^This was defeated by randomising the position and initial scale of the pattern in later versions of Supercharge. Eventually a version without the Lenslok code was produced, for a bundled deal with US QL distributors A+ Computer Response, but by that time Turbo, the inevitable follow-up product, was on its way.... |http://www.simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/commercial.html#QL^^

Note that 19,200bps is nominal. The maximum throughput at 19,200 setting is actually a little under 14,400 bps. It simply means 19200 can be used without error.

wikipage: SuperQBoard
wikitext: The SuperQBoard was a disk interface card from [Sandy] with up to 512K RAM, a centronics parallel printer port and Toolkit 2 on board. The 256K version could be upgraded by a small plug-in RAM card.

There were three revisions of the board. Version 1 had a heatsink by the QL connector, and 256 KB on-board. A 256 KB daughterboard would bring it up to the full compliment of 512 KB. This board implemented a floppy interface by way of a WD1770 floppy controller. 

Version two deleted the heatsink and carried no memory, using a modified standard 512K Sandy memory expansion as a daughterboard. The deletion of the heatsink often meant that the 7805 voltage regulator could get very hot, but it remained within specification. 

This version implemented the floppy using a WD1770 or 1772 floppy controller. 

The third version had tracks that could be optionally populated with components to implement a standard QIMI mouse interface. 

All boards included [TK2] on EPROM.

These boards were sold from 1985 to 1987.

Versions one and three are shown in the pictures below.

wikipage: SuperToolkit
wikitext: SuperToolkit is perhaps better known as Toolkit II - it has become the standard toolkit expected by the majority of Sinclair QL programs released since 1987.

Originally released on microdrive cartridge, under the name [QL Toolkit] by [Sinclair Research Ltd], SuperToolkit became a much enhanced version of this toolkit addition to the QL's SuperBASIC.
 
SuperToolkit adds a wide range of commands to SuperBASIC, including a full screen SuperBASIC editor (ED), commands to handle wildcards in filenames and user defined characters; and standard directory support, for example:
 
PROG_USE flp1_%%%
DIR%%%
WCOPY flp1_,flp2_%%%
PAUSE%%%
LRUN boot
 
will return the directory of files on flp1_, copy all files from flp1_ to flp2_ and then run the program flp1_boot. These were simply standard kind of defaults, to let the user omit the drives name. Most software of that time does ignore them. They are definitely no hard directories! Later versions of Toolkit II include the command "MAKE_DIR" to create them, depending of the hardware and the driver.
 
Commands also allow you to control jobs (set priority, remove jobs, suspend jobs), chain programs together to act as filters, dump screens to a printer, set a QL up as a file server (or printer server) and a lot more.
 
There are also improvements to the QL networks and error handling (JS and MG ROMs only).

SuperToolkit was released on disk or microdrive cartridge as the [Configurable Toolkit], or on ROM cartridge as SuperToolkit.

Subsets of SuperToolkit were also built into disk interfaces, or supplied as an update to the disk interface ROM chips as [QFLP].  However, the products produced by [Miracle Systems] included the full Toolkit II built in.

The ROM version (and that built into [Miracle Systems] hardware products was required if you wanted to use the improvements to the network devices provided by SuperToolkit / Toolkit II, as only the ROM version could ensure the consistent timing required.

There appears to be some confusion surrounding this book.

A search of the internet reveals a book by Michael de Sosa, called __Taking the Quantum Leap - Using the Sinclair QL__ published in both hardback and soft cover by McGraw-Hill in 1985 (ISBN: 0070165785).

There do not appear to be any more details of this book.

We have also now seen a large A4 ring-bound book (269 pages), entitled __Taking the Quantum Leap - The Last Word on the Sinclair QL__, also by Mike de Sosa, and published by Time Designs Magazine in 1987 - this is the one pictured.  The acknowledgements page gives thanks to an editor at McGraw-Hill, so perhaps this is one and the same publication?

It forms not only an indepth look at the Psion programs and how to use them to best advantage, but also the QL itself - its hardware and its SuperBASIC, with plenty of routines and short demonstration programs throughout.

It even touches on ideal QL systems using the hardware and software at the time - and touches on the Thor and Futura computers.

Perhaps this was a series of books - can anyone clarify this?

wikitext: Talent Computer Systems published a wide range of games and adventures for the Sinclair QL and Atari computers.  They originally used a Wicat, an up market 68000 based machine, running under Unix for software development.  All of their early software was written in Stab, a language developed at Strathclyde University, which is related to C and BCPL.

They were best known for producing [QL Paint] under the Sinclair label and the ground breaking (and ever-needed) [Cartridge Doctor] which would attempt to rescue damaged files from microdrive cartridges automatically (or as Talent coined it - automagically).

Talent changed its name to Colin Ross Malone Ltd. and is still in business. They now concentrate on educational products and documentation for large organisations such as HP and the National Health Service. 

At some point, their address was Curran Building, 101 St James Road, Glasgow G4 0NS, UK

Their catalogue of software, together with the Sinclair QL titles published by [Microdeal], [Shadow Games] and [Chisoft] were purchased by a Tom Dolezal who trades as Talent+.  Much of their software is still available from [RWAP Software].

Tally consists of Sales Ledger, Sales Invoicing and Stock Control and originally cost £115.  A second module 'Tally II' covered Purchase and Nominal Ledgers, and cost an additional £59.50.

The modules were said to integrate not only with themselves, but will all four Psion programs (Quill, Archive, Abacus and Easel), so that you could for example, use Sales Ledger and Quill together to produce standard letters, or use Easel to display in graphic form the data entered in the Stock Control module.  

The software was also supposedly designed to run both under both the [CP/M 68K Operating System] and standard QDOS.

However, when Quest acquired the rights to [QL Cash Trader] in 1985, Tally was dropped in favour of the improved features included in [QL Cash Trader].

wikitext: Tandata Marketing Limited of Malvern, were known for the production of their [Tandata Modem] stack for the Sinclair QL which provided a 1200/75 baud modem, plus fully buffered RS232 interface and auto-dialler / auto-answer module.
*************************** 904. row ***************************

wikipage: Tandata Modem
wikitext: !!!Tandata Modem

The Tandata QL modem consisted of a three-stack set of devices, originally designed and marketed in 1985 by [OE Limited] of Cumbria as 'QCOM' (OE Limited had previously developed and sold the Prism VTX 5000 modem for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum) - when that company folded, despite suggestions that [Sinclair Research Ltd] would rescue the modem (as it was to be the Sinclair approved QL Modem), the rights to the modem were eventually purchased by [Tandata Marketing Limited] and relaunched as the Tandata Modem stack.

The modem was made up of three modules which stacked on top of each other - the Q-Connect module for connecting to the QL (required) and the optional Q-Mod (modem) and Q-Call (automated dialling unit).  The QL power unit plugged into the back of the Q-Connect module, which then had a flying lead to power the QL.


!!Q-Connect

Q-Connect connects to the QL SER2 port allowing the computer to be used with virtually any asynchronous modem from 75 up to 9,600 baud, with full two-way buffering and flow control. Q-Connect was supplied with software on microdrive cartridge to support this and the other two modules.  The software also supports both Prestel/videodata/videotext and VT100 emulation, as well as user-to-use communications.

Q-Connect not only provides the interface for the remainder of the Tandata modem stack, but also provides an industry standard 25 way D-pin RS232 port.

This was originally called Q-Con when marked by [OE Limited].

Original price of Q-Con as at December 1984: £79.95

!!Q-Mod

Q-Mod was a manual dial V23 modem operating at 1200/75 baud and 1200/1200 baud half duplex.

Original price of Q-Mod as at December 1984: £79.95

!!Q-Call

Q-Call provided traditional pulse/loop disconnect auto-dial and auto-answer.  The auto-answer facility permitted incoming calls to be accepted automatically and to trigger pre-programmed activity from the QL.

Original price of Q-Call as at December 1984: £49.95

The software to drive the interface and operate the phonebook, was [Q-Connect] and was provided on microdrive cartridge.

Although the three modules were available separately, Tandata suggested that by using all three as a complete matched system full advantage could be taken of the integrated features of the Q-Connect's software.

The Tandata units were popular with QLers in the 1980s for use with the Prestel service and for Bulletin Board System connection.  There was even a special database area set aside for QLs on the Prestel Microcomputing Service (QNET)

Tascopy QL is a flexible screen dump program from [Tasman Software Limited].

This provides a simulated colour screen dump of the Sinclair QL screen to a range of different printers, accessed via new commands added to QL SuperBASIC.  These commands allowed you to print a shaded copy of either the entire QL screen, or a specified window.

Tascopy could also be used to produce large poster size screen copies printed onto several sheets of paper (which would be cut and joined to make the poster), as well as high speed small copies.

wikipage: Taskmaster
wikitext: Taskmaster started life as a task switcher written by Andrew Pennell for [Medic Datasystems Ltd].

Peter Jeffries then took over the responsibility for TaskMaster whilst working at Medic Datasystems, improving the code and adding new features to the program (using the HiSoft [Devpac QL] which was also written by Andrew Pennell).

Following the collapse of Medic Datasystems, a former Medic customer (John Norton) persuaded Peter Jeffries to finish the program and the file tools and it was eventually launched as a commercial program by [Sector Software].

Taskmaster matured into a multitasking/task switching front end for the Sinclair QL, which allows you to run multiple programs in their own windows, with all of the programs multi-tasking, meaning that they all run at the same time - for example, you could set your database printing out labels and still use your word processor or any other programs at the same time. 

Taskmaster also includes a file handling program similar to Windows File Manager, a pop up notepad and pop up calculator which once closed with a two key combination transferred the text out of the notepad or the result from the calculator to the underlying program. This allows, for example, the ability to be working in your accounts package and, with a simple keypress up popped up the calculator, you can perform your calculations and then by pressing two keys the calculator closes down and as it disappears it types the result to the input box on your accounts package.

The notepad tool also works in the same way. 

Taskmaster also provides a macro recorder and player language which could operate ANY program running in your machine thus automating common tasks; a software based printer buffer which was configurable to use spare RAM. 

Taskmaster also stores details of what programs you were using when you last closed down the QL, and then re-loads them ready for use when you switch the computer back on.

Peter states that he and John Norton became friends and worked together on both [Spellbound] and [Flashback]. Peter recalls one time John surprised him with a 6 foot rotating sign he'd made from scratch, for a ZX Microfair show to advertise Taskmaster. It was very impressive, especially for a Microfair.

Another time he recalls was when they arranged the hiring of an attractive model for a show. But the poor girl just kept getting pushed away as keen buyers crowded around their trestle table.

Tasprint QL was written by [Tasman Software Limited] and is advertised as 'the style-writer'.  Basically, it takes text files (such as those which can be exported by Quill) and allows you to edit the text file on-screen and change portions of the text to use different font styles.

The fonts are generated using the built in UDG font codes on many printers (which have built in fonts!).  Although the different fonts are not shown on screen during the editing process, you can see special characters which mark the start and end of each font change.

Tasprint QL comes with 5 different fonts which can be applied to a document - 
* Compacta - heavy and bold font, good for emphasis
* Data Run - a futuristic script
* Lectura Light - clean and easily read font
* Median - a business font
* Palace Script - a distinctive, flowing font (that looks to be joined up writing).

You can also add one of four styles to each font - normal, inverse, boxed or underlined.

Taxcalc is a program written by the Consumers' Association to help you complete your income tax return.

By answering a series of questions about yourself, including income, expenditure and allowances, the program will calculate the income tax you should have paid during the year and can be used to help complete the bewildering tax returns issued by the Inland Revenue and claim a tax refund (where applicable).

Unfortunately, we have only seen three versions of this program released - one for each of the tax years 1985-86, 1987-88 and 1988-89.  Presumably sales did not justify the investment in continuing with this program, although there was also presumably one released to cover the 1986-87 tax year.

This version is probably one of the most well known terminal emaulators for the Sinclair QL in the early days, supporting file transfer and VT52 emulation.

The program is Preset compatible, which meant that QL users could access one of the largest UK bulletin boards (including Micronet 800).  The software stores your logon identity number and supports various Prestel facilities, such as 'reveal' which displayed information hidden on special pages.

The program also includes a built in screen editor which can be used to edit or prpare text.

It was provided with the [Miracle Modem] and the [QL Modaptor].

wikipage: Text87
wikitext: Text87 is a word processor for the Sinclair QL, which was a first for the QL, in that instead of being based around the QL's fonts and graphics, had custom drivers which were based on the fonts and printing capabilities of certain supported printers.

This provided a new level of wysiwyg software for the Sinclair QL, in that the software attempted to represent as far as possible the same output on the QL screen as you would see on the final printed copy.

A range of additional programs were also published to help you use Text87 with a wider range of printers, and to help you modify the fonts used on-screen to more closely represent those used by your printer.

The additional programs are:%%%
* [2488] - extra drivers for use with Text87 Plus 4 - aimed at 24 pin printers and bubble jet printers%%%
* [Fountext88] - graphics drivers for use with Text87 Plus 4%%%

wikitext: Text87 Plus4 is an upgraded version of the original [Text87] word processor for the Sinclair QL.

The Plus4 version is a complete re-write of the original software, incorporating the [QTyp] spelling checker, and requires at least 256K extra memory, plus a disk drive and a monitor (as it makes full use of the 512x256 screen resolution of the QL).  Later patches were released to allow Text87 Plus4 to use even higher screen resolutions.

Text87 Plus4 also allows you to use multiple windows and multiple files at the same time - although to allow this, you have to specify the amount of extra room to be set aside for each document when loading (ie. the maximum amount of memory which your changes to the document will be allowed to use).  It also introduces the ability to add Text Sections (for marking, formatting or extracting) and multiple layouts for each document.

A separate [Text87 Plus4 Patch] is available which allows you to patch the program to run in high colour displays.  French, German and Italian versions were also produced.

The Adventure is an improved implementation of the Crowther and Woods original adventure (later known as "Colossal Cave").  The Crowther and Woods adventure is seen as the very first adventure game ever written for a computer - although their version was written for an early mainframe computer, not for people ot use at home.  

This implementation is text only and is based around the premise that you need to explore your world, gathering treasure and working out how to get around obstacles using the items which can be found littered about the game.  All the treasure has to be returned to the treasure room in order to complete the game.

With magic spells to transport you back to locations, this game has always proved popular amongst fans of interactive fiction (or text adventures).

The program was released on several other platforms, including the Sinclair ZX81, [Sinclair ZX Spectrum|http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseek.cgi?regexp=^Adventure+1$&pub=^Abersoft$&loadpics=1], [Amstrad CPC|http://www.cpc-power.com/index.php?page=detail&num=570], BBC Micro, [Commodore Plus/4|http://plus4world.powweb.com/software/Classic_Adventure], [Commodore 64|http://www.gb64.com/game.php?id=1508] and the [MSX Computers|http://www.generation-msx.nl/software/melbourne-house/classic-adventure/2740/].

The race is on!

With around 140 locations, and a cable car sequence, this is not an adventure for the light hearted.

It was also made more difficult by the fact that objects were not always listed until you look under other objects, and sometimes you had to look several times, until you see a message that there are no more objects!

The King is a good colourful implementation of the arcade favourite Donkey Kong.

In the game, you are attempting to reach the top of a tower in order to rescue a damsel in distress, guarded by King Kong.  King Kong is throwing barrels down at you which roll along the platforms, or can drop vertically.  

In this variant, you can pick up a mallet to smash the barrels, but if any of them reach the barrel of oil at the bottom left hand corner of the screen, they turn into a small monster that moves back up the screen, making it even more difficult.

The Lost Pharaoh is a very colourful game where you play the role of an explorer looking for lost treasure inside the Pharaoh's tomb, if you can find your way through the labyrinth of underground passages which lead to the sealed burial chamber.  

You need to acquire keys to open gates and there are hidden tunnels - you can enter the green tunnels, but beware the blue ones out of which all manner of dangerous insects and snakes appear.

There is a map of the overall system available if you are stuck!

wikipage: The Prawn
wikitext: The Prawn is a spoof text-only adventure based on the original Sinclair QL adventure [QL Pawn] written by [Magnetic Scrolls].

In this version, you play the role of a Prawn who was scooped up in a trawler net and you end up on a strange land, wearing a copper tail-band, which must have been placed on you during your sleep because you cannot remember how it got there. Many features of this game are similar to the Pawn, although not all of the puzzles can be solved in the same manner. There is a philosopher, an itinerant salesperson, a magician who arrives on a giant pop bottle top, a castle with gardens to explore, a mountain with a cave, an Ice Tower guarded by a shrimp and even a tree stump!!

Originally published for the Sinclair QL computer, thanks to the [QL2K] emulator, [RWAP Adventures] have now released a version for Windows.

wikipage: The Quill
wikitext: ((http://www.rwapadventures.com/images/The_Quill_packaging.jpg|Inlay for The Quill Adventure Writer for Sinclair QL|align="i"|Insert for Sinclair QL The Quill))%%%
The Quill is perhaps one of the best known adventure writing systems released for a range of computers, including the Sinclair QL Home Computer.

The program allows you to create a database of your adventure, including rooms, objects, descriptions and characters, and then store them in a portable format along with a built in interpreter ready to run on your machine.  

Many commercial titles were produced using The Quill on a wide range of computers.  For the Sinclair QL, these were:
*[The Prawn]
*[Horrorday]
*[Dennis the Dwarf at the Funfear]
*[Quest for the Dragon Sword]
*[The Voyage of the Beano]

Unfortunately, the later improvements released for The Quill (such as the Illustrator which allowed graphics) and the Professional Adventure Writer (PAW) with the improved interpreter, were never converted to the Sinclair QL.  

That said, Alan Pemberton created the public domain Quill to SuperBASIC utility which allowed you to create a SuperBASIC program which would run adventures written in The Quill.  Graphics could then be added to the adventure, as was shown to great effect with [The Voyage of the Beano].

This utility was also essential to ensure that the generated games could be played on the various different Sinclair QL variations.

Because the programs are written in SuperBASIC, their structure is extremely modular. Each module is concerned with a particular task in the simulation, and each such task is described with great clarity.

The Simulator is a flight simulator by [Ekotek Datasystems].

The features include%%%
* Simulation of an imaginary light aircraft
* Realistic Cockpit instruments
* Real-time graphics representing the outside world in 3D
* View of the outside world in four directions in black & white or in full colour (52 colours in all)
* Three levels of difficulty
* Report facility giving information on flight time, total distance flown, fuel consumption and more
* Different worlds can be loaded from microdrive cartridge or floppy disk.  Each world has up to five airports and contains many objects to aid orientation during the flight.

The GUI, sound, aeroplane physical model and user interaction were written in SuperBASIC and compiled with [Q-Liberator]. All 3d calculations are done in machine code. The worlds (of which there were several), with their coordinates and colours, are coded in text files. 

Also you were only allowed to make 5 copies, although this can be got around by using [Digital Precision]'s clone program or you can simply attach the disk image now available to [Q-emuLator].

The Sinclair QDOS Companion is an in-depth guide to the working of the Sinclair QL's operating system, QDOS and how to interface to it when writing machine code, including how to use its multitasking facility and how to link to peripherals.

It includes an overview of the Sinclair QL's second processor, the Intel 8049 chip which is used to handle peripheral devices, such as the keyboard and sound, and how to control it without using QDOS.

A useful guide, it suffers now from assuming that the system variables would always be stored at $28000 and the screen at $20000 which was not the case in later QL operating systems.

wikipage: The SuperBASIC Extensions EPROM
wikitext: The SuperBASIC Extensions EPROM is first mentioned in the Summer Software Survey contained in QL User (September 1985) and accredited to Logical Operators with a price quoted of £29.95.   

Having spoken with the author, Adam Denning, he has clarified that the intention was for him to publish the toolkit under his own company (Logical Operators), but then he started working for HiSoft, who then published the program - this is evidenced by the review of the program in Sinclair User (Issue 43), which states that the program was published by HiSoft at a price of £34.95.

This toolkit is supplied on an EPROM cartridge and contains 70 commands and includes routines to trace SuperBASIC execution, a function key definer and true windowing facilities (with commands such as SSAVE, SLOAD and SSHOW used to store windows in memory and refresh them).

Many of the commands overlap with the [QL Toolkit] and a large number of the commands are devoted to job and data management, stream and file handling and the use of machine code, with commands such as QTRAP which allow you to directly access the QDOS trap routines.

The toolkit also includes dedicated commands to automatically create and print high score tables.

The toolkit was later known as the __Super 'B' Toolkit__

A wide range of modules which can be very useful when learning the best way to program the Sinclair QL, with clear explanations of the code used.

Interestingly there is a program which appears at the end of the book (the Checksum Generator) which you can use to check if the example programs you have entered into the QL from the book are correct or if you have made any errors.

Formerly an employee at the Philips Research Laboratories in Redhill, Surrey where he worked on realtime image processing, using electronic hardware rather than software, Tony Tebby began working for [Sinclair Research Ltd] and wrote the operating system for the QL which was being developed at the time.

Tony left Sinclair supposedly in protest at the premature launch of the QL, to form his own company, [QJUMP], a software house specializing in system software and utilities for the QL, and continued to extend the capabilities of QDOS through the creation of tools such as [SuperToolkit], [QPAC2] and most recently the completely re-written operating system [SMSQ/E].

His operating system was also ported to other machines through Tony's work - including [SMS2] (developed for the Atari ST) and Stella, an embedded operating system for 68000-series and ColdFire processors.

wikipage: Touch Typist
wikitext: Touch Typist is a well respected typing tutor package which was written in 1985 specifically for the Sinclair QL.

Its author, David Batty recalls:

^^In 1985 I went in to WH Smiths in Preston and saw a typing tutor for sale for £29.95. I told the shop assistant who I regularly chatted to, that the software was over priced and that I could write better myself. He challenged me and I set about writing Touch Typist to prove my claim.|http://sectorsoftware.co.uk/about-2/^^

^^Two weeks later after working flat out I took a program in to show him and he was amazed that it was better than the one he was selling, he said that I should market it. I then set about writing new features and expanding the software until it was ready for sale. I managed to get an Enterprise Allowance grant of £40 per week for one year to start up self employed writing software, later on that year I attended a computer show in London as an exhibitor selling my one product. I sold about 19 copies in one day.|http://sectorsoftware.co.uk/about-2/^^

Touch Typist went on to be converted to run on other computers including the Atari ST, Commodore Amiga, Acorn Archimedes, Cambridge Computers Z88 and Windows based computers.

The software features very short lessons, each less than 55 characters long. Feedback after every lesson helps to keep the user interested in improving their typing skills. The first version of the software had a Space Invaders game built into it that the users were allowed to play once for every 20 lessons they completed. However, as Touch Typist was 95K in size, the game had to be written in 68000 machine code, so that it could fit into just 2K of memory!

The game was removed in second and subsequent versions after requests from various schools who were using the software, for a version without an arcade game in it.

The latest Windows based version is [available online|http://www.typingtutor.co.uk/]

wikipage: Trading Accounts
wikitext: The history of the program Trading Accounts is closely tied to that of [QL Cash Trader].

Trading Accounts was originally a slightly enhanced version of the very original [QL Cash Trader] and sold by [Quest Automation Ltd].

However, when Quest Automation Limited disappeared from the Sinclair QL scene, [PDQL] released both their own re-written version of [QL Cash Trader] and also an enhanced program called Trading Accounts.

The PDQL version of Trading Accounts took [QL Cash Trader] into the format that it is known as today - with the built in CT Analyser module, navigation by initial letter (as well as scrolling) and varying size groups.

Trading Accounts therefore still remains available as the latest version of [QL Cash Trader].

wikipage: Transact
wikitext: Transact was originally published by [Dialog Software] in 1985 and was heralded as a book-keeping system and nominal ledger package.

It maintained double entry principles and was based on the manual books of Prime Entry Sales, Sales, Purchases, Bank and Petty Cash transaction types.  It could optionally calculate VAT and net transaction values and you could obtain a full audit trail.

Supported 100 accounts under 10 section headings, with 2 accounts reserved for Accrual and Prepayments, with bank, cash, debtor, creditor and VAT controls pre-set (leaving 90 user definable account headings).

The program produced VAT clearance account to control VAT payments and rebates, and also a profit and loss figure, and quick Balance sheet.

As you enter transactions, the system is not updated on the fly, and you have to remember to undertake a Nominal Ledger Update once you have entered your transactions. Unfortunately, being written in SuperBASIC, the program could be prone to breaking due to errors when entering information.

Advertised features:
*Transaction files emulate the manual books of prime entry, sales, purchases, bank and petty cash
*Standardised and fast input format
*Optional down-calculation of VAT and Net transaction values
*Automatic assignment of debit and credit values
*Validation checks to ensure that entries balance
*Double entry principals maintained at all times
*VAT input and output accumulations recorded separately
*Journal facilities provided for accounts adjustments
*Standard reports and audit trail to screen and printer

wikipage: Transform
wikitext: Transform Limited (Transform) were based in Beckenham, Kent.

Although Transform were mainly a supplier of third party products, they are probably best remembered for devising the __Transform Microdrive Storage Box__.

The Transform Microdrive Storage Box was a stackable box with a hinged lid and room to hold 20 microdrive cartridges in total.  A small plastic plate was provided to connect several Storage Boxes together.

A black version was provided for the Sinclair QL and Sinclair ZX Microdrive units, with a brown version produced for the ICL One Per Desk computer.

Transform also produced some of its own software:

*[QL Appointment] - A useful diary program
*[QL Mail List] - A program to maintain a mailing list
*[QL-Switch] - A program to switch between the four Psion programs [Quill],[Archive], [Easel] and [Abacus].
*[Stock Control] - A program to keep a record of stock

wikipage: Transformer
wikitext: Transformer was advertised in the April 1989 edition of Sinclair QL World, by [Schön] Personal Computer Products as an alternative full blown IBM PC/MS-DOS emulator for the QL.

It was to be on display at the Alternative Micro Show that year, and was marketed as a previously unadvertised product, with professionally written ROMable code which supports both CGA and MDA.

The wording of the advert was part of the emulator wars at the time, and was designed to mark it aside from both the [IBM PC Emulator] from [Ant Computing] which was advertised by [Schön] in the March 1989 edition of Sinclair QL World and [The Solution] from [Digital Precision].

By June 1989, the description of the product had changed and it was marketed as "to be the fastest PC/MS-DOS emulator for the QL" and this time being supplied as a piece of hardware providing both the software and CGA emulation.

Unfortunately, we cannot find any reference to this post July 1989 and it may therefore never have been released.

This is a version of Cluedo, where you are attending a house where there has been a murder.

It is not clear what the correct title of the program is, as it is listed as 'Trivia-QLUE' on the side of the cassette case, but named as 'Executive-QLUE' in the game itself.

You have to guess which room the murder was committed in, the name of the murderer and the weapon.  There are 13 rooms, 13 weapons and 13 suspects to choose from.

However, in order to be able to make a guess you first of all have to answer a trivia question (there are over 700 questions in the game, covering religion, history, science, geography and astronomy.

Tantalisingly, there is a slip inside the cassette case which says that included on the cartridge was a program called [LIFE EXPECTANCY].  According to an old [RMG Enterprises catalogue|http://www.rwapadventures.com/documentation/RMGEnterprises-catalogue-Dec1986.pdf] this was a life expectancy predictor or you might receive a football forecaster instead.

Unfortunately neither were included on our microdrive cartridge.

wikipage: Trump Card
wikitext: The QL Trump Card from [Miracle Systems] soon became the standard expansion interface for the Sinclair QL, incorporating [Toolkit II], a floppy disk interface and breaking through the 512K memory barrier on the QL, providing an additional 768K memory.

This meant that for the first time, the Sinclair QL could have 896K memory, plus Toolkit II on ROM and access to disk drives, all on one small card which plugged into the expansion bus.  The additional memory also increased the speed of the QL.

Other people released updated ROMs for the Trump Card, which provided Level-2 Drivers (allowing you to control sub-directories) and built in device drivers to access PC disks.  The Trump Card was also released as Trump Card 2, which worked more quickly.

The [Miracle Disk Expander] could be used with the Trump Card to provide it with the ability to control up to 4 floppy disk drives.

The Trump Card remained the mainstay of the average Sinclair QL user, until [Miracle Systems] released the later [Gold Card] and [Super Gold Card] interfaces.

wikipage: Turbo
wikitext: After [Supercharge] came Turbo, produced by a team including Gerry Jackson, Chas Dillon and [Simon Goodwin]. A huge effort went into producing this compiler, which produced faster code than either Supercharge or [Q-Liberator].

According to [Simon Goodwin], the original version of Turbo (v1.13) was actually a beta version with features missing, never intended for release. In order to meet the pressure from [Digital Precision Limited] to release Turbo early (although the eventual release date was only just a couple of months before Simon's planned release date), Gerry Jackson and Chas Dillon were brought on-board and planned features had to be scrapped (Turbotext and an optimiser phase).

Turbo compiles most programs the major exception, for versions before 5.01, being its inability to allow parameters to be passed to machine code routines by reference. This restriction was removed in 2005, in version 5.01. 

Turbo uses a dedicated toolkit of BASIC extensions called Turbo Toolkit. Turbo could produce stand-alone QL executables, but needed a runtime version of the Turbo Toolkit if it used toolkit extensions.

Unlike its predecessor [Supercharge], Turbo never used the Lenslok system, the software protection was more by means of a large paper manual printed in black ink on red paper, which was difficult to photocopy, although uncomfortable to read.  Turbo also did away with the need for software houses to purchase a license or pay any royalties for commercial programs compiled with Turbo, which was a major benefit over [Supercharge].

Turbo was probably the biggest selling SuperBASIC compiler and often managed to generate substantial debate between Turbo aficionados and [Q-Liberator] users as to which was the best QL compiler!  One of the main reasons for this debate was the fact that Q-Liberator was less strict over the SuperBASIC which it could compile, whereas both Supercharge and Turbo complained more about poor programming.

*PCW Benchmark 1: SuperBASIC 1.7, Turbo (floating point) 0.1, Turbo (Integers) 0.05 seconds
*PCW Benchmark 2: SuperBASIC 4.8, Turbo (floating point) 0.2, Turbo (Integers) 0.08 seconds
*PCW Benchmark 3: SuperBASIC 7.9, Turbo (floating point) 0.5, Turbo (Integers) 0.2 seconds
*PCW Benchmark 4: SuperBASIC 7.7, Turbo (floating point) 0.7, Turbo (Integers) 0.15 seconds
*PCW Benchmark 5: SuperBASIC 10.0, Turbo (floating point) 0.8, Turbo (Integers) 0.25 seconds
*PCW Benchmark 6: SuperBASIC 20.2, Turbo(floating point) 1.7, Turbo (Integers) 0.55 seconds
*PCW Benchmark 7: SuperBASIC 36.5, Turbo (floating point) 2.4, Turbo (Integers) 0.9 seconds
*PCW Benchmark Integer Math: SuperBASIC 10.4, Turbo (floating point) n/a, Turbo (Integers) 0.6 seconds
*PCW Benchmark Real Math: SuperBASIC 13.2, Turbo (floating point) 0.6 seconds, Turbo (Integers) n/a

The planned features which were never released were:
* Turbotext (a subset of [Speedscreen] which would optimise text display in aligned CSIZE 1,0;
* An Optimiser which would run between parser and compiler phases (some of which capability ended up in later versions of Turbo through work by Gerry, Chas and George based on Simon's development plans). With this phase, the program would have made more use of the faster templates are rather under-used (for example fast float incrementation - which is now only used in STEP 1 FOR loops).  There would have also been a 'peephole window' to identify other times it could be used: by design it was capable of optimising adding or subtraction of powers of two (1, 2, 4 etc) to float values, typically addresses or indices, in common cases which otherwise dominate loop runtime; 
* Constant folding (particular useful with MANIFEST);
* Trigonometric strenth-reduction (similar to what was implemented in [Lightning] (and implemented more effectively by my Simon's FPUFNs for later 68K systems).

Turbo has continued to be maintained as a public domain program with thanks mainly to George Gwilt.  To complement this version, a toolkit (TurboPTR) has also been released which allows you to interface Turbo compiled programs with the Pointer Environment.

wikipage: TurboQuill
wikitext: TurboQuill and TurboQuill+ is a third party program which modifies [Quill] to improve its speed, adding around 8K of code to the main Quill program.

Once Quill has been adapted by TurboQuill, you have to use a special config program (supplied with TurboQuill) instead of the original provided by Psion, as the offsets of the defaults within the program are moved.

Another program (Spellmod) is included with TurboQuill in order to adapt [Spellbound] to work correctly with the amended version of Quill.

The changes made by TurboQuill are:
* Improvements to the speed of Quill
* Cursor in Quill changes colour to show whether CAPS LOCK is pressed or not
* Glossary function added, allowing you to store key sequences for quick entry into Quill with CTRL + letter key.  CTRL S provides a special function which injects the stored sequence as soon as you start up Quill, allowing you to load a standard letter for example.

Tycoon is a business game devised by Victor Serebriakoff (the then International President of MENSA) and is based on crossword puzzles - up to 6 players can take part at a time, the object being to guess the words in a crossword to sell them to the bank, making as much money as possible.

You can borrow money (subject to interest) to buy specific or random letters from the bank and also invest your hard-earned capital to earn interest.

However, beware that you lose money by putting in incorrect words.  Can you become a Tycoon by making more than £10,000 by the end of the game?

This is an interesting game and quite difficult, with plenty of crossword variations (49) to keep you going.  Each player can set a different difficulty level.

Type 22 was published by [Talent Computer Systems] and is an accurate real-time simulation of a Royal Navy type 22 frigate at war.

The object of the program is to stay afloat for as long as possible with the various tools at your disposal, including a Lynx helicopter, chaff, and missiles.  You will need to identify and shoot down enemy aircraft and sink enemy shipping (including submarines).

There can be up to 20 different targets for you to engage with at any time!

The author also wrote a version of the program, Type 23 for the Atari ST.

wikipage: Typeset90-GQ5000
wikitext: Typeset90-GQ5000 is an additional set of printer drivers for the [Text87 Plus4] word-processor.

These printer drivers are designed specifically to make the most of Epson GQ5000 and GQ3500 laser printers, supporting the whole of the QL's international characters and symbols (except for CHR$(175) and CHR$(181) which have been replaced with fractions - 1/2 and 1/4).

The GQ language is quite a change from the ESC/P2 language used on the majority of Epson's printers - the GQ language is very fast, and as a result, Text87 immediately starts printing, even with very complex documents.

This GQ driver also works with Epson EPL 5200 printers, if a separate GQ language board from Epson was installed into the printer. 

The drivers support internal scalable and bit-mapped founts.

wikipage: Typeset93 (ESC/P2)
wikitext: Typeset93 (ESC/P2) is an additional set of printer drivers for the [Text87 Plus4] word-processor.

These printer drivers are designed specifically to make the most of ESC/P2 based printers, such as some Epson dot matrix printers and inkjet printers, such as the Epson LQ100 and LQ570 printers.  

The drivers support internal scalable and bit-mapped founts.

A patch is available from {Marcel Kilgus's website|http://www.kilgus.net/qpcprint/downloads.html] which fixes a potential issue with these dirvers aligning text - the original drivers place texts with a resolution of only 180dpi, character spacings however are 360dpi. This patch can update the driver to use 360dpi all the way. 

You need the original driver for this to work (file size 44512)

wikipage: UCSD Fortran-77
wikitext: UCSD Fortran-77 was developed to be totally compatible with UCSD Fortran-77 developed for a range of machines by the Regents of the University of California.

Unusually, UCSD Fortran-77 does not generate native 68008 machine code, but instead generates an intermediate p-code, which then runs under an interpreter, allowing for easy debugging of a running program, by immediately calling up an editor to look at the statement causing an error.  The interpreter (known as the p-System), was designed so that the same source code could run on any machine with a p-System (the p-System was designed as the system for an ideal machine for running Pascal). The p-System was developed at the University of California at San Diego, by a team headed by Kenneth W. Bowles during the 1970s.

The final p-code is more compact than the alternative 68000 machine code, although you may wish to rewrite sections of the code in native machine code in order to obtain the maximum speed (although it must be noted that the supplied assembler was only 16 bit, and could not cope with the 32 bit addressing modes native to the 68008 processor).

However, one of the downsides to using this implementation of Fortran, is that you need to learn and become accustomed to the p-System operating system which is menu driven, and has an integral screen editor and filing system (luckily a good manual - 'Operating System Reference Manual' - was included with the program).

Although originally supplied on microdrive cartridge, disk drives or RAM drives were ideally required, as the p-System is I/O intensive and needs to constantly refer to files stored on disk.

It also did mean that completed programs would need a licensed copy of the p-system on which to run, if you were to supply them to a third party.

wikitext: UCSD Pascal was developed to be totally compatible with UCSD Pascal developed for a range of machines by the Regents of the University of California.

Unlike [METACOMCO PASCAL], UCSD Pascal does not generate native 68008 machine code, but instead generates an intermediate p-code, which then runs under an interpreter, allowing for easy debugging of a running program, by immediately calling up an editor to look at the statement causing an error.

Although originally supplied on microdrive cartridge, disk drives or RAM drives were ideally required, as the p-System is I/O intensive and needs to constantly refer to files stored on disk.  However, the QL version's performance was much quicker than the Acornsoft/TDI Software implementation for the BBC Micro.

It also did mean that completed programs would need a licensed copy of the p-system on which to run, if you were to supply them to a third party.

A version of UCSD Pascal was also released by [TDI Software Limited] for the Apple Mac, called 'MacAdvantage', with a mouse-based Editor and enhancements to access the Mac's ROM routines (such as pull down menus).  It is a shame that these enhancements were not brought across to the QL version.

The earliest (first advertising in QL User, November 1985) were based in Barnsley, South Yorkshire and offered one item for the Sinclair QL:
*[QCLEAN] - A microdrive cleaning system

A much better known trader, Ultrasoft, based in Düsseldorf, Germany, which was later run by Martin Berndt. In the beginning, there were a few other authors involved, e.g. Jochen Merz, Christian Caan von Seelen and Axel Pabich.

Amongst the titles released by the German Ultrasoft, were:
*[DiskTool]
*[Graphic Construction Kit]
*[Mandelbrot Magic]
*[Perfect Pointer Tools]
*[QKick]
*[QLone+]
*[Toolkit III]

The German Ultrasoft also manufactured various hardware items for the Sinclair QL, all designed by Ulrich "Uli" Rosowski, including:
*[U+5] - Buffered expansion backplane
*[UltraCard] - Connect up to 6 EPROMs to the QL
*[UltraKey] - Keyboard conversion

wikipage: Urs Koenig
wikitext: Urs König (born 1968) is Swiss and lives in Lucerne, Switzerland.

During his professional education in the automotive service sector Urs started [COWO Electronic] in 1984. He ran the business in parallel to his education, military services - where he served as an officer in telecommunication - and daytime jobs.  After joining AGRO-DATA AG as software developer in January 1992, COWO Electronic's activities were fading out and came to an end in 1995. Urs kept the COWO logo and brand name for future usage.

Urs wrote several software packages for the QL. The most important ones were: [ANIMATIONSGRAFIK] (BOUNCING BALLS] in 1986/1987, [TURBO-ANIMATION] in 1987/1988, [QTop] (fka [THOR-DESK]) in 1988-1995, QTop v2 (beta only) in 1991, QTop v3 (written in C, beta preview only) in 1995 and QTop/E in 2000-2002.

In January 1998 Urs declared [QTop] and other COWO Electronic software packages as freeware. The software was then submitted as is to [Gerhard Plavec] for inclusion on the QL-PD/CD-R, the first of many QL related [CD-ROMs].

Nowadays Urs maintains QLing as a hobby with different activities such the Sinclair QL Preservation Project's (SQPP) [SinclairQL.net website|http://www.sinclairql.net] (information, documents, software). Urs also runs the 
[QLvsJAGUAR YouTube video channel|http://www.youtube.com/user/QLvsJaguar|English and German| The biggest Sinclair related video archive on the web].

In April 2010 Urs founded a new legal company called [COWO Enterprises GmbH|http://www.cowo.ch]. His new company focuses on consulting and software engineering on the Microsoft platform.

Viewpoint is a 3D computer aided design package for the Sinclair QL by [Rubicon Computer Systems].

It allows you to draw an image in 3D, and then orientate the view on screen (tilting and turning the object as required).  You can add text to the image, but this is stationary and not included as part of the 3D image.

You are able to also remove hidden lines from the drawing, but unfortunately, there is no ability to shade the surfaces.

You can then either print the image, save it for use in Viewpoint, or as a flat screen image for use in your own programs.

Vroom is an early car racing game produced by the French software house [Pyramide] for the Sinclair QL where you take the place of a Formula One driver.  The graphics are quite good, being presented in 3D with the view from the driver's cockpit.

The QL version is limited to only 5 different circuits, and according to its author, sold around 3200 copies in the UK.  This differs from the other Formula 1 racing game for the Sinclair QL, [Hyperdrive] in that there are no hazards on the track, other than the other cars.  You can, however, go off the sides of the track, which makes driving more difficult!

Oddly, the packaging for QL Vroom shows the title as Wroom as can be seen on the picture!

The advertising blurb detailed:%%%
* 100% Machine Code
* Realistic Racing Simulation as seen from inside F1 car
* 3-D Perspective Graphics
* Moving Meandering Tracks
* 5 Different Circuits
* Colourful and Elaborate Backgrounds
* Impressive Sound Effects
* Keyboard or Joystick Control
* Wheels and Steering Wheel Movements


The author, Daniel Macré went on to release an updated version of Vroom for the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga computers in conjunction with another software house, Lankhor.

[An interview with Daniel Macré|http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6zhqd_interview-de-daniel-macre_videogames||Interview with Daniel Macré] was recorded in 2009 (in French) by [MO5.com|http://www.mo5.com] - a video game preservation project and museum in France.

War in the East is a table top wargame, which places you in charge of the Axis armies in World War II as they try to take Russia and hold it through the Russian Winter against the onslaught of the Russian forces. 

War in the East was originally programmed by Mark Stueber of Sharps Inc in SuperBASIC (and sold as three independent modules).  [RWAP Software] then released an updated version of the program, as an upgrade to the original, which, due to failure to reach agreement with the original author over a sale price, was never released in its own right.

The RWAP Software version (War in the East MKII) has the following additional features:
* Correction to bugs in the game
* Correction to routine used for display of fonts, so that it worked on all QLs
* Improvements to speed of play (including compiling the game with [Turbo] and custom scrolling routines)
* Addition of 2 player and postal games
* Changed to work from disk
* Ability to continue playing the next module from the end point of the previous module - making for longer term strategic planning.
* Improved computer intelligence

Can the well-trained Axis armies defeat the badly organised, but much larger Russian Armies? 

The Axis have to deal with changing morale of their troops as time marches on and the Winter sets in (without much winter supplies) as well as the Technological advances made by the Russians who are defending their Motherland.

West is a real-time text only adventure, which was written with a game generator designed by Alan Black. 

Originally published by [Talent Computer Systems] in 1984, this game proved very popular, with a desert maze which changed each time that you re-started the game.

The game is based in the Wild West, where you play the part of a sheriff with only a trusty six-shooter and a steed as friends. You are on the track of a notorious gang of bank robbers who have gone to ground near an abandoned mining town deep in Indian territory.  They have hidden the stolen loot. Your task - to outwit and outgun the robbers, collect as much loot as possible and piece together clues on how to escape. Can you survive this harsh environment and escape from this gold-rush town?

You have to cope with Red Indians, bank robbers and rattlesnakes. Events happen in real-time outside your control - Indians charge, rattle-snakes slither past and robbers appear and shoot you.

Originally published for the Atari ST and Sinclair QL computers, thanks to the [QL2K] emulator, [RWAP Adventures] have now released a version for Windows.  It was also advertised as being available for the Commodore C64, BBC and Electron computers.

A few details appear in the September 1985 issue of QL User (Summer Software Survey), where it explains that it has a good 3D graphic display which gives it a kind of monster maze feel, but lacks greatly in content.

The advert was:
>Can you survive the perils of __WESMONSTER PALACE__ to deliver the once proud leader of the realm from her malady.

>Exploring the 3 dimensional corridors and chambers can you survive and complete your mission?  On successful completion a new more difficult game is seeded.

wikitext: W N Richardson & Co was set up by [Bill Richardson] during the 1980s.  He managed to take advantage of [Sinclair Research Ltd] closing down production by taking over the stock of Spectrums and Sinclair QLs returned under warranty for repair - it was easier for Sinclair to simply send a replacement in many cases and the issues could be very minor.

Bill was well known for attending QL shows with a wide range of hardware, from disk drives, to printers and boxed QLs even when in his 80s!  Over the years he had dealt with many 1000s of sales of Spectrums, ZX Microdrive units, boxed QLs and Cambridge Z88 computers

The last of his stock was passed over to [RWAP Software] when Bill eventually retired in 2008

Word Processing on the Sinclair QL proves a useful introductory guide to using the Psion [Quill] word-processing program, provided with the Sinclair QL Home Computer.

It covers topics such as changing typefaces, document layout, margins, tabs and printing your data.

A useful guide, it forms part of the QL Series of books, which formed the mainstay of many a QL'ers library in the early days.

Unfortunately, this suffers from being based on the first version of [Quill].

wikipage: Wreck Dive
wikitext: Wreck Dive is a graphic adventure based underwater.

You play the role of an undersea diver, exploring a wreck of a ship ("the Spindrift") sunk in 1954 in search of long lost wedding gifts which were on board ship and valued at around $1 million.  You need to swim about the wreck, using the cursor keys, and following the access ways up and down between decks whilst avoiding the hazards, such as giant clams which will trap you, and sand that will slow you down.  Don't forget your way back to the air tanks!

The graphics were a little bit of a let down in this early graphic adventure, as they are quite simple.  There are however, 6 decks and about 140 rooms to explore.

We even have a hand-written solution to the game if anyone is stuck.

wikipage: Xchange
wikitext: Xchange was a total business solution package, written by [Psion] and combining their four existing packages, [Quill], [Archive], [Easel] and [Abacus].

As well as improving the ability to run multiple instances of each program and being easily able to switch between them from a simple front end menu, Xchange offered its own TCL programming language which allowed you to write macros which could be run entering commands and data into the various programs.

Xchange was initially released for the DOS based IBM PC, Graduate, Apricot and Sirius computers, as well as the Sinclair QL based ICL One Per Desk and Merlin Tonto computers.  It was then also re-packaged for release with the [THOR XVI] Sinclair QL compatible.

The [THOR XVI] version of Xchange was then adapted to run on standard QL home computers with a minimum of 640K memory.

There is also a faster version of Xchange, called "Turbo-XChange", which was produced and patched by Martin Berndt (very early after the Thor launch of the program) for personal use with a modified screen driver and other modifications, so that this program runs faster but just on a QL with at least 640k memory. Martin also produced an mdv-based version of Turbo-XChange, using two mdvs and a loader program, which combines the two parts in memory, then executes Turbo-XChange.

Due to a change in the Thor 'watermark' test in this program, although Turbo-Xchange would run on standard QLs, it would no longer run on a Thor XVI.

Zapper was published by [Eidersoft] and written by [Janko Mrsic-Flögel]. It is loosely based on the well-known Arcade game Space Invaders. In the game, you are defending a planet from swarms of aliens descending from above - there is nowhere to hide, just you and your trusted laser weapon.  Fast and furious, the aliens  can get past you to attack again from above and the more you shoot, the faster they move. Featuring excellent graphics, the game is controlled by cursor keys or cursor emulating joystick.  The main issue with the game is that you can only fire one missile at a time.

wikipage: Zappit!
wikitext: __Zappit!__ is a sprite editor from [Quest Automation Ltd] which provided an easy means of creating, editing and adding moving coloured sprites to your own SuperBASIC programs, using in-built machine code functions.

You basically have a sprite movement file, which details the number of sprites you wish to create, their size in pixels and position of each sprite.  You then enter the number of pixels in a chosen direction that the sprite will move.

Having done that, you then create a separate sprite shape file, which determines the colour of each individual pixel for each sprite (in 8 colours), allowing you to see a magnified view of the sprite, as you enter the details.

A neat utility.

Advertised features include:
*Up to 99 sprites on screen simultaneously
*Each sprite in up to 8 colours
*Up to 80 x 40 pixel size
*Automatic collision detection
*Adds 13 new BASIC commands
*Can be incorporated into your own program from BASIC, no PEEKs or POKEs required

wikitext: De Sinclair QL thuis computer kwam uit in 1984 - de opvolger van de eerdere Sinclair computers, de ZX80, ZX81 en ZX Spectrum.

De QL werd uitgebacht als een zakelijk apparaat, compleet met twee ingebouwde microdrives, 128kB, toetsenbord op volle grootte en 4 zakelijke programma's van Psion. (Quill - tekstbewerker, Archive - programma voor gegevensbeheer, Easel - grafieken, Abacus - electronisch rekenblad) en een krachtige SuperBASIC.

Helaas leden de vroege QLs aan onbetrouwbare programma's van Psion, onbetrouwbare microdrives en een derde van de ROM zat in een "dongel" aan de achterkant van de QL. Dit leidde ongelukkigerwijs tot nog al wat slechte persberichten.

Een bijgewerkte versie werd echter al vrij snel vrijgegeven en de QL bleef populair onder een harde gebruikerskern, met twee vervangende besturingssystemen (Smsq/e en Minerva), talrijke emulatoren en zelfs aansturingsprogramma's voor 16bits kleuren.

Een breed scala aan zakelijke programma's en spelletjes zijn er door de jaren heen uitgekomen, en de QL wordt nog steeds ondersteund door een aantal handelaren, een gebruikersgroep ([sin_QL_air|http://www.xs4all.nl/~wij2/sinqlairnl.html]) en zelfs een tweemaandelijks blad ([QL Today|http://www.qltoday.com/]). Er is ook een populair [e-mail forum|http://www.q-v-d.demon.co.uk/smsqe.htm] voor discussie's over allerlei aan de QL relateerde zaken.
